# Gsoc 2021 Blog
A small blog to track my progress on the DBpedia Gsoc 2021 project.

## 17/05/2021 Results announced
I have been chosen to develop a tool to convert DBpedia abstracts into RDF triples, I can't wait to get started!
Here you can find more information about the [project](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6560166180290560)

## 3/06/2021 Community Bonding: First community meeting
Call to meet with almost all DBpedia/GSoC mentors and students and get to know all the projects.
Here you can find a linkedin publication about this [meeting](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dbpedia_students-mentors-gsoc-activity-6806219042404282369-rpOy)

## Coding week 1 (07/06/2021 - 14/06/2021)
In this first week i have been reviewing the code of the last two participants on this proyect, testing the code and making my own version of it in order to generate the first triples. Explained in detail [here](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week1)

## Coding week 2 (14/06/2021 - 21/06/2021)
In this second week I have tried to rethink the whole project and use different approaches to extract my own clauses. We have simplified the problem to get closer to a good base solution. Explained in detail [here](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week2)

## Coding week 3 (21/06/2021 - 28/06/2021)
In this third week i have continued with the approach introduced in week 2 (exploring subtrees) trying to introduce improvements. At the moment we continue with the simplified problem to get closer to a good base solution. Explained in detail [here](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week3)

## Coding week 4 (28/06/2021 - 05/07/2021)
TODO. Explained in detail [here](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week4)
