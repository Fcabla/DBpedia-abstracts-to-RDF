# Statistics and benchmarking

sacar numeros de cuantas frases, cuantas rdf tripletas, simples / complejas



## Conclusions
In conclusion, during this week the foundations of the application have been built and the first final results have been achieved. 

In the next week we will test on a large dataset and extract some metrics such as the number of simple and complex sentences that exist in the selected sample, the number of text triplets generated by each type of sentence, the number of rdf triplets that could be extracted from the text triplets, etc.

The last week will be devoted to the construction of two simple web applications, one to generate RDF from the input text and the other to provide users with a tool to contribute to the construction of the verb lexicalization table.
