# Code 

In this directory you can find several folders: 

The **scripts** folder contains some scripts that have been used during the project and are not part of the main pipeline. Inside this folder you can find another Readme file with a description of each one.

On the other hand there is the **codingweeks** folder where you can find python scripts with the format cw + number, this means coding week + number. This has been done in this way to be able to have clear the differences of the application between different weeks.

The files that contains _old in their name are pieces of coded that were tested during that week and will not be used for now. In the future this files will be removed from the repo.
