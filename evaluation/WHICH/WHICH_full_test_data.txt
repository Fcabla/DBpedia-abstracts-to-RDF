The 1933–34 Lancashire Cup was the twenty-sixth occasion on which the completion had been held. Oldham won the trophy by beating St Helens Recs by 12-0.

The 1957 German Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on 4 August 1957 at Nürburgring. It was race 6 of 8 in the 1957 World Championship of Drivers. The 22 lap race was won by Juan Manuel Fangio, and is often cited as one of the greatest victories in racing history. It was Fangio's fourth victory out of the seven races in the season contested by Formula 1 cars - excluding the Indianapolis 500, in which only US drivers competed, using USAC Championship cars. Furthermore, due to the number of points he had accumulated in the season (34 to Luigi Musso's 16), his victory at the Nürburgring mathematically clinched Fangio's fifth World Championship title with two races to go. The race was also notable for being Fangio's 24th and last victory in F1; his career still stands as having the highest win percentage ever, with 46.15% of his 52 race entries being wins.

The 2018 Kaveri River water sharing protests are a series of ongoing protests on the issue of water sharing problems from the River Kaveri between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka which are two states in India. The Kaveri water dispute has been a major controversial issue between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka over the years and the issue has been raised further with protests have been conducted across the state of Tamil Nadu by several groups including from the large pile of actors and directors who have temporarily stopped working on their projects, films over the Karnataka's sharing the Kaveri water to Tamil Nadu. The delay in establishing a Cauvery Management Board in order to share equal river share award has sparked off protests in Tamil Nadu against the Karnataka state government. Several film makers of the Tamil film industry has also criticised and threatened to postpone the IPL matches involving Chennai Super Kings which are to be held in Chennai as a part of the 2018 Indian Premier League season as Chennai Super Kings making their comeback into the IPL league after 2 years as they were serving a 2-year ban along with Rajasthan Royals over the 2013 IPL betting scandal. This situation in Tamil Nadu has been a major concern along with the Nadigar Sangam's strike against the increase of VPF charges which has left the South Indian state vulnerable with no new film releases for about 50 days. The 2018 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election which was a major concern in the state of Karnataka following the breakout of major Kaveri river water scandal has heaped in among several political dramatic turnarounds in the state with both main politicians B. S. Yeddyurappa and Siddaramaiah being historically defeated at the assembly elections.

Acylamino-acid-releasing enzyme is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the APEH gene. This gene encodes the enzyme , which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the terminal acetylated amino acid preferentially from small acetylated peptides. The acetyl amino acid formed by this hydrolase is further processed to acetate and a free amino acid by an aminoacylase. This gene is located within the same region of chromosome 3 (3p21) as the aminoacylase gene, and deletions at this locus are also associated with a decrease in aminoacylase activity. The acylpeptide hydrolase is a homotetrameric protein of 300 kDa with each subunit consisting of 732 amino acid residues. It can play an important role in destroying oxidatively-damaged proteins in living cells. Deletions of this gene locus are found in various types of carcinomas, including small-cell lung carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma.

Airport-to-airport mutual aid programs provide expert assistance and material support to an airport that has been affected by a natural or manmade disaster on a voluntary basis from other airports. The concept has been described as \"airports helping airports.\" The first example in the world was the Southeast Airports Disaster Operations Group (SEADOG), which was founded in 2004-2005 under the leadership of Savannah-Hilton Head International Airport and Orlando International Airport. The initial emphasis of SEADOG was assistance to airports recovering from hurricanes. SEADOG's first mobilization was to Pensacola International Airport after Hurricane Ivan in 2004. SEADOG's most notable mobilizations were to Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport and Gulfport-Biloxi International Airport after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and to Jack Brooks Regional Airport to assist with urban search and rescue operations after Hurricane Ike hit Galveston and Houston in 2008. More than 20 airports from all over the U.S. contributed assistance through SEADOG after Hurricane Katrina. SEADOG has a dedicated website. In 2007, the Western Airports Disaster Operations Group (WESTDOG) was formed under the leadership of Portland International Airport. WESTDOG's mission was nearly identical to that of SEADOG although WESTDOG's primary focus is earthquakes, but there are minor administrative differences between the two disaster operations groups (DOGs). Unlike SEADOG, joining WESTDOG requires a formal resolution by the airport authority, port authority, city, or county that owns the airport. WESTDOG has a written operations manual and a dedicated website (WESTDOG 2011-2013). The fundamental principles of airport-to-airport mutual aid are that no one can help an airport as well as someone from another airport, no mandatory requirement to send assistance, no self-deployment, matching of specific needs for skilled airport personnel and equipment to volunteered personnel and equipment, and self-sufficiency of the deployed assistance teams. Since the DOGs are mutual aid programs, there are no financial arrangement built into the program. If an airport deploys through SEADOG or WESTDOG in a disaster that is the subject of a Presidential disaster declaration, then reimbursement and liability coverage under the Stafford Act and using the procedures of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC) apply. Both SEADOG and WESTDOG depend on coordinating airports that volunteer for that role. SEADOG has four airports that coordinate geographic regions and three specialized coordinators for aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF), law enforcement and security, and rapid engineering assessment. The airports serving in these roles have indefinite terms. WESTDOG has a primary coordinating airport and a secondary coordinating airport that serve one-year terms, with the secondary airport moving up into the primary role after one year. Both DOGs have created permanent communications systems for the dissemination of alerts and the management of volunteered resources and matching of volunteers to need. SEADOG and WESTDOG communicate closely and collaborate. They had their first joint SEADOG-WESTDOG Annual Conference at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport on 16–18 October 2013. There are no DOGs in any other region of the United States (IEM et al. 2012). However, airports outside the southeastern and western states have provided aid through SEADOG. Membership in SEADOG or WESTDOG is open to any airport regardless of location in the United States. There is a third airport-to-airport mutual aid program, the Colorado Aviation Recovery Support Team (CARST). Established by the Colorado Airport Operators Association (CAOA), CARST provides specialized, highly experienced airport and aviation professions to help an airport or community deal with issues involved in recovering from a crash. CARST grew out of experiences with the Avjet crash at Aspen-Pitken County Airport (ASE/KASE) in 2001. In 2012 the Airport Cooperative Research Program (ACRP) of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) of the National Academies published a guidebook for how to establish, manage, and sustain an airport-to-airport mutual aid program. It is ACRP Report 73. There are no airport-to-airport mutual aid programs outside the United States, but the feasibility of an airport-to-airport mutual aid program for Latin America and the Caribbean has begun to be considered by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) of the United Nations (UN), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and several other organizations. Many observers have believed that mutual aid could not operate across national borders because of barriers created by legal, language, and cultural differences and delays created by work rules, customs and duties, and immigration. It has been proposed that inclusion of airlines, national agencies, and international agencies and industry associations such as the International Air Transport Association (IATA), Airports Council International (ACI), and American Association of Airport Executives (AAAE) can overcome such barriers by sharing their day-to-day expertise operating internationally. Formalization of the proposal is expected in 2014. If the DOG for Latin America and the Caribbean is implemented in full or as a pilot project in a subregion such as the Caribbean Basin or Central America, it will probably be the first cross-border airport-to-airport mutual aid program in the world outside the United States.

Apteronotus rostratus is a species of apteronotid electric fish. These fish typically exhibit a wide diversity of skull shapes, ranging from highly elongate skulls to highly foreshortened ones, with both types evolving independently multiple times. In Apteronotus rostratus and some others, such as Compsaraia samueli, mature males grow extremely elongated snouts and oral jaws which are used in agonistic interactions with other males. This is an example of . A study comparing skull shape and jaw-closing performance in males and females of Apteronotus rostratus suggested that males with elongated faces for use in fights did not have lower mechanical advantages, in contrast to the similar species Compsaraia samueli in which males exhibit a trade-off between sexual weaponry and jaw leverage.

Arbanitis robertsi is a species of tube spider in the family Idiopidae found in and near rainforests in New South Wales and Queensland, Australia. A mid to large sized spider which builds a tube of web that extends from the burrow. The tube is attached to rocks, tree ferns or the base of trees. Thousands of these tubes were recorded by Sid Jackson in November 1922 at the south eastern end of Wallis Lake. \"Up to three feet long, and half an inch wide\". Situated on damp ground, close to freshwater streams.

Established diplomatic relations have existed since 1949, when Australia recognised Indonesia's independence. Historically, contact between Australians and Indonesians began as early as the 16th century prior to the arrival of the Europeans, through Makassan interactions with indigenous Australians on Australia's western and northern coasts. The relationship has been characterised by growing mutual trade of A$17.8 billion in 2018–19, an increase of 6.9% over the previous year, in addition to close links in government, education, and defence under the Lombok Treaty. Both nations are members of the G20, ASEAN Regional Forum, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the ASEAN Free Trade Area, the Indonesia–Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (IA-CEPA) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), among other organisations. Relations between the two countries are generally well, though there have been some strained periods since 1949, most notably the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation (where Australia sided with Malaysia), the East Timor crisis in 1999 (in which Australia plays a significant role), the issues of West Papua, asylum seekers, and the disclosure Australia's wiretapping on some Indonesian officials in 2013. Cooperation between the two has strengthened each other in various fields, including the economy. Both are committed to an open economy by increasing trade and investment cooperation embodied in the IA-CEPA (which was ratified in February 2020 and takes effect on 5 July 2020). In February 2020, both countries celebrated 70 years of diplomatic relations during Indonesian President Joko Widodo's visit to the Australian Parliament in Canberra.

Baoding Military Academy or Paoting Military Academy (Chinese: 保定軍校; pinyin: Bǎodìng Jūnxiào; Wade–Giles: Pao-ting Chün-hsiao) was a military academy based in Baoding, during the late Qing dynasty and early Republic of China, in the first two decades of the 20th century. For a time, it was the most important military academy in China, and its cadets played prominent roles in the political and military history of the Republic of China. The Baoding Military Academy closed in 1923, but served as a model for the Whampoa Military Academy, which was founded in Guangzhou in 1924. It, along with the Yunnan Military Academy and the Whampoa Military Academy, was one of the “three major strategist cradles in modern China”. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, half of 300 divisions in China's armed forces were commanded by Whampoa graduates and one-third were Baoding cadets.

Brachyplatystoma is a genus of catfish from the family Pimelodidae. As the occasionally used common name goliath catfishes indicates, this genus includes some of the largest species of catfish, including the piraíba, B. filamentosum, which reaches up to the region of 3.6 metres (12 ft) in length. Brachyplatystoma are found in the Amazon and Orinoco basins, and other tropical freshwater and brackish habitats in South America. Some species are migratory. These fish are important as food fish and, to some extent, aquarium fish.

The Chillicothe Water and Power Company Pumping Station is a historic building on the northern side of Chillicothe, Ohio, United States. A Gothic Revival structure built in 1881, it was constructed to house the city's waterworks and power plant. Its architecture and its location in Yoctangee Park was chosen specifically in order to beautify the park as well as to have a location near other elements of the city's first waterworks, which were built at the same time as the pumping station. From 1881 to 1882, Chillicothe constructed a water supply system; among the elements of this system were a well, a massive reservoir, the pumping station in Yoctangee Park, and water mains to supply all parts of the city. A single-story building with a two-and-a-story tower, it is a brick structure with a foundation of sandstone and a slate roof. By the late 1970s, Chillicothe had erected a new waterworks, and its electricity was supplied by other sources; consequently, the old building was abandoned. Ideas were proposed for its renovation and preservation: plans were laid for its conversion into a community center, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places late in 1979. Key to its designation as a historic site was its historic architecture, primarily because of its construction as an \"ornament\" for Yoctangee Park. Today, the pumping station has been converted into an art gallery, the Pump House Center for the Arts.

Climate change in Kentucky encompasses the effects of climate change, attributed to man-made increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, in the U.S. state of Kentucky. The United States Environmental Protection Agency reports: \"Kentucky's climate is changing. Although the average temperature did not change much during the 20th century, most of the commonwealth has warmed in the last 20 years. Average annual rainfall is increasing, and a rising percentage of that rain is falling on the four wettest days of the year. In the coming decades, the changing climate is likely to reduce crop yields and threaten some aquatic ecosystems. Floods may be more frequent, and droughts may be longer, which would increase the difficulty of meeting the competing demands for water in the Ohio, Tennessee, and Cumberland rivers\". In May 2019, The Kansas City Star noted that climate change is suspected in the increasing number of tornadoes in the region, \"the band of states in the central United States ... that each spring are ravaged by hundreds of tornadoes — is not disappearing. But it seems to be expanding\", resulting in a higher frequency of tornadoes in states including Kentucky.

A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of additional writes and storage space to maintain the index data structure. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to search every row in a database table every time a database table is accessed. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access of ordered records. An index is a copy of selected columns of data, from a table, that is designed to enable very efficient search. An index normally includes a \"key\" or direct link to the original row of data from which it was copied, to allow the complete row to be retrieved efficiently. Some databases extend the power of indexing by letting developers create indexes on column values that have been transformed by functions or expressions. For example, an index could be created on upper(last_name), which would only store the upper-case versions of the last_name field in the index. Another option sometimes supported is the use of partial indices, where index entries are created only for those records that satisfy some conditional expression. A further aspect of flexibility is to permit indexing on user-defined functions, as well as expressions formed from an assortment of built-in functions.

David Keyte (born 1954) is an English businessman and football chairman. Keyte went to Hereford Cathedral School and played for Hereford United Reserves in the 1970s, having been signed by Colin Addison. He also played football for Westfields. He was also a cricketer, playing as a wicket-keeper for Worcestershire 2nd XI Keyte trained as an accountant. In 2000, he was appointed Bursar at Bredon School, an independent school near Tewkesbury. Quickly promoted to General Manager, he bought the school in 2002 and became Principal. In 2009, he sold the school whilst remaining as Principal before retiring from his position in the summer of 2010. Keyte became chairman of Hereford United on 4 June 2010. He was introduced to his vice chairman Tim Russon by Joan Fennessy, the outgoing company secretary, two months previously. At the end of the 2011/12 season Hereford United were relegated from the football league and began the 2012/13 season in the Conference Premier. The club finished a creditable sixth place in its first season back in non-league football but struggled financially and players were left unpaid at the end of the season, with Keyte explaining that players were informed that they wouldn't be paid by text message. As the 2013/14 season began the club continued to struggle on the pitch and were left battling a second relegation in three seasons, only securing their place in the Conference on the final day of the season with a victory over Aldershot Town. The club also struggled once again off the field during the 2013/14 season and players were routinely denied payment despite constant reassurances from Keyte and the Hereford United board. Despite a huge fundraising effort from fans which raised tens of thousands of pounds to pay an overdue tax bill, players were once again left without wages at the end of the season. In June 2014 David Keyte sold Hereford United to Tommy Agombar, a London-based businessman, reportedly for £1, despite receiving an offer for the club from the Hereford United Supporters Trust. The new owners of the club declined to pay a financial bond to the Football Conference, resulting in the club's expulsion from the league. Shortly afterwards the Hereford United players released a statement regarding the non-payment of wages during the 2013/14 season, claiming that Keyte and the board of directors \"are to blame for the 90-year old club's expulsion from the Conference\". The statement continued: \"Every week, David Keyte assured senior professionals he would meet the outstanding wages in full. On survival, David Keyte promised to email players every week to keep them informed of what monies were available to pay players. Instead he has ignored players calls and asked who they were when answering some players after apparently losing phone numbers.\" In December 2014 Hereford United were wound up in the High Court and the club's Southern League record was expunged. Early in 2015 Keyte was spotted at Edgar Street with Chris Swan, the chairman of Redditch United. It later transpired that Redditch United had made a move to play football at Hereford United's former ground.

Ephrin-B3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the EFNB3 gene. EFNB3, a member of the ephrin gene family, is important in brain development as well as in its maintenance. The EPH and EPH-related receptors comprise the largest subfamily of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases. EPH receptors typically have a single kinase domain and an extracellular region containing a Cysteine-rich domain and 2 fibronectin type III repeats. The ephrin ligands and receptors have been named by the Eph Nomenclature Committee (1997) based on their structures and sequence relationships. Ephrins are divided into the ephrin-A (EFNA) class, which are anchored to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage, and the ephrin-B (EFNB) class, which are transmembrane proteins. Ephrin-B ligands also contain an intracellular tail with highly conserved tyrosine residues and a PDZ-binding motif at the C-terminus. This tail functions as a mechanism for reverse signaling, where signaling occurs into the ligand-containing cell, as opposed to the cell with the receptor. Upon receptor-ligand interaction the tyrosine residues become phosphorylated and there is recruitment of PDZ domain-containing proteins. The Eph family of receptors are similarly divided into two groups based on the similarity of their extracellular domain sequences and their affinities for binding ephrin-A and ephrin-B ligands.EphrinB3 has been implicated in mediating various developmental events, particularly in the nervous system. EphrinB3 reverse signaling is important for axon pruning and synapse and spine formation during postnatal development of the nervous system. Previous work has also shown that signaling through this ligand is important for radial migration during cortical development. Moreover, levels of EFNB3 expression are particularly high in several forebrain subregions compared to other brain subregions, and may play a pivotal role in forebrain function. It has been suggested that ephrinB3 signaling is necessary for synaptic plasticity to occur in the hippocampus; this implicates ephrinB3 as a major player in learning and memory. More recently, ephrinB3 has been shown to regulate proliferation of neural stem cells in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ).

Ewa Tomaszewska (born 14 April 1947) is a Polish politician who currently serves in the Sejm, and previously served as a Member of the European Parliament from 2007 to 2009. Born in Płock, she graduated from the University of Warsaw in 1974 with a degree in physics. She joined the Solidarity movement in 1980, and was an activist for the group through the 1980s. In 1983, she was arrested after attempting to place a plaque up at the Wujek Coal Mine, which was under martial law at the time as a result of the Pacification of Wujek. After being released the following year, she returned to Warsaw and became a research worker. In 1990, Tomaszewska served on the Solidarity Social Reconciliatory Committee to return political activists to work, and she also served on the Social Policy Council during the presidency of Lech Wałęsa. She was also part of the Social Assistance Council from 1995 to 1999. She was first elected to the Sejm in 1997 out of Warsaw, and was chairperson for the Social Policy Committee.

The Glidden Tours, also known as the National Reliability Runs, were promotional events held during the automotive Brass Era by the American Automobile Association (AAA) and organized by the group's chairman, Augustus Post. The AAA, a proponent for safer roads, acceptance of the automobile and automotive-friendly legislation, started the tour to promote public acceptance and bring awareness of their goals. The original Glidden Tours were held from 1904 until 1913. They were named after Charles J. Glidden, a financier and automobile enthusiast, who presented the AAA with a trophy first awarded to the winner of the 1905 tour. In 1906, the Glidden Tours were the first motor race to use a checkered flag to indicate the end of the race: divided the courses into sections; the time check at the end of each section was performed by race officials called \"checkers.\" These checkers used checkered flags to identify themselves. The first two days of the 1907 edition of the Glidden Auto Tour were marred by a number of accidents that resulted in the death of one man, Thomas J. Clark, lifelong friend and partner of John K. Stewart, and four other persons severely injured. While trying to make a sharp angle in the road preparatory to crossing a bridge, about two miles east of Bryan, Ohio, Mr. Clark lost control of his Packard that jumped over an embankment. The car turned over and he was crushed between the steering wheel, suffering several ribs broken and serious internal injuries, from which he succumbed four days later at Bryan hospital. It is believed that Mr. Clark was demonstrating the Stewart speedometer on the 1907 Glidden Auto Tour. At the turn of the century automobile travel was difficult as the road systems around the world were generally not well suited for the horseless carriage. To bring more awareness and sponsorship to the event, the AAA announced that the tour would be a \"reliability and endurance\" tour, a type of road rally. This attracted automobile manufacturers who competed to test their vehicles and use the events for advertising. The tours were gruelling events: cars broke down, were damaged by accidents, and encountered nearly impassable roads. Drivers and teams did repairs on the run and helped out other drivers having difficulties. The tours went several hundred miles in the US and occasionally into Canada with time limits between check points and a point scoring system to determine a winner of each event. The time limits caused some problems with the inhabitants of where the tour traveled through as autos scared horses, caused personal and property damage and sometimes appeared to not care.

The Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany (Große Landesloge der Freimaurer von Deutschland, GLL FvD or GLL), also: Order of Freemasons (Freimaurerorden, FO) is a Masonic Grand Lodge in Germany. It is one of the founding members of the United Grand Lodges of Germany and as such it is one of the five German Grand Lodges recognized as \"regular\" Grand Lodges by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE). The Grand Lodge was established in 1770 by Johann Wilhelm Kellner von Zinnendorf, a Prussian army physician. It is one of three so called Old Prussian Grand Lodges. The Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany works according to a slightly modified version of the Swedish Rite. It therefore differs from other German Grand Lodges both in its content and organizational structure. However, as a masonic Grand Lodge it is not a religious community and affiliation to a particular Christian denomination is not required. Neither is it necessary for a member of the Order to be expressly Christian, however the Rules of the Order demand that every member \"recognize the teachings of Jesus Christ as they are written down in the Holy Scripture\". The Order of Freemasons demands that its members keep working continuously at the development of their own personality. Rationality and conscience, inner freedom and self-knowledge as well as being conscious of one's responsibilities are regarded as the necessary means by which one can approach the finding of the origin, character and destiny of mankind and the whole of existence.

Greg Quinn (born 1950) is an American farmer in Staatsburg, New York, who with the help of several state senators and assemblypersons overturned a 1911 New York state ban in 2003 on the commercial cultivation of blackcurrants, a berry fruit used in juice, jams, candy, yogurt, ice cream, and cereal that provides twice the antioxidant ORAC capacity per serving of blueberries, four times the vitamin C content of oranges, and twice the potassium content of bananas. With no supply and no market, his company, CurrantC, began to grow black currants on his 135-acre (55 ha), farm and Quinn sought to interest consumers and New York farmers in the fruit, which was then being supplied to the United States by Europe.CurrantC is the number one supplier of Currant products in the United States.In addition to farming and teaching at the New York Botanical Garden, Quinn has written eight children's books published by Scholastic Press, including the titles A Gift of a Tree, The Garden in Our Yard, 365 Meditations for Teachers, and books within the Natural Treasure series. He also has written for SKY magazine, Good Housekeeping, and Fine Gardening and has been \"The Garden and Nature Guy\" on WHUD and other Pamal Broadcasting radio stations, and FOX 5 television, WNYW out of New York City.

A greguería is a short statement, usually one sentence, in which the author expresses a philosophical, pragmatic, or humorous idea in a witty and original way. A greguería is roughly similar to an aphorism or a one-liner joke in comedy. It is a rhetorical and stylistic device used in Spanish and Latin American literature.

In wildfires, a holdover fire, zombie fire or overwintering fire is a peat fire which persists from year to year.

Hydroelectricity, or hydroelectric power, is electricity produced from hydropower. In 2020 hydropower generated one sixth of the world's electricity, almost 4500 TWh, which was more than all other renewables combined and also more than nuclear power. Hydropower can supply large amounts of low-carbon electricity on demand, making it key to many secure and clean electricity grids. With a dam and reservoir it is also a flexible source of electricity, since the amount produced by the station can be varied up or down in seconds or minutes to adapt to changing energy demands. Once a hydroelectric complex is constructed, the project produces no direct waste, and it almost always has a considerably lower output level of greenhouse gases than fossil fuel powered energy plants. However, when constructed in lowland rainforest areas, where inundation of a part of the forest is necessary, they can emit substantial amounts of greenhouse gases. The construction of a hydroelectric complex can cause significant environmental impact, principally in loss of arable land and population displacement. They also disrupt the natural ecology of the river involved, affecting habitats and ecosystems, and the siltation and erosion patterns. While dams can ameliorate the risks of flooding, they also contain a risk of dam failure, which can be catastrophic.

Ink Master is an American reality competition television series that aired on Paramount Network (formerly called Spike), premiering on January 17, 2012. The show features tattoo artists who compete in various challenges assessing their tattooing and related artistic skills. They are judged by renowned tattoo artists and enthusiasts, with one or more contestants eliminated each episode. The last contestant standing each season receives a $100,000 prize, the title of Ink Master, and a feature in Inked Magazine. The series is produced by Original Media, which also produced the reality show Miami Ink. Three spin-off shows, titled Ink Master: Redemption, Ink Master: Angels and Ink Master: Grudge Match, have also been released. The series has also released a number of special standalone episodes themed around upcoming events or holidays, such as Halloween. The tenth season (titled as Ink Master: Return of the Masters) premiered on January 9, 2018, and aired its first two episodes on Spike before the network rebranded as the Paramount Network. On April 24, 2018, it was announced that Paramount Network had renewed the series for an eleventh season. The twelfth season, titled Ink Master: Battle of the Sexes, premiered on June 11, 2019. On November 12, 2019, it was announced that the thirteenth season titled Ink Master: Turf War would premiere on January 7, 2020. On September 22, 2020, Paramount Network cancelled the series, as part of the network's shift to movies. On December 1, 2020, the first two seasons were made available to stream on Netflix in the United States and were later removed on December 1, 2021. The same day seasons 3-4 were added. On February 24, 2021, it was announced that the series would be revived by Paramount+.

JWH-007 is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It was first reported in 1994 by a group including the noted cannabinoid chemist John W. Huffman. It was the most active of the first group of N-alkyl naphoylindoles discovered by the team led by John W Huffman, several years after the family was initially described with the discovery of the N-morpholinylethyl compounds pravadoline (WIN 48,098), JWH-200 (WIN 55,225) and WIN 55,212-2 by the Sterling Winthrop group. Several other N-alkyl substituents were found to be active by Huffman's team including the n-butyl, n-hexyl, 2-heptyl, and cyclohexylethyl groups, but it was subsequently determined that the 2-methyl group on the indole ring is not required for CB1 binding, and tends to increase affinity for CB2 instead. Consequently, the 2-desmethyl derivative of JWH-007, JWH-018, has slightly higher binding affinity for CB1, with an optimum binding of 9.00 nM at CB1 and 2.94 nM at CB2, and JWH-007 displayed optimum binding of 9.50 nM at CB1 and 2.94 nM at CB2. Another drug similarly named (not JWH) is a cocaine analog (the di-para-fluoro benztropine, being essentially a hybrid between benzatropine and difluoropine; with fluorine groups in the former or being descarbmethoxy in the latter) and atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor, but is distinct from and not the same as this JWH-007.

The Jamaican football league system is the national football competition system in Jamaica. It is organized by the Jamaica Football Federation. The Jamaica National Premier League is the top-flight of football in Jamaica Below this, the clubs are separated on geographical grounds. Dependent on which parish a club is located in, it is a member of a specific confederation. \n* Clubs from the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew are members of the Kingston and St. Andrew Football Association (KSAFA). \n* Clubs from the parishes of Clarendon, Manchester, St. Catherine and St. Elizabeth are members of the South Central Confederation. \n* Clubs from the parishes of Portland, St. Ann, St. Mary and St. Thomas are members of the Eastern Confederation. \n* Clubs from the parishes of Hanover, St. James, Trelawny and Westmoreland are members of the Western Confederation. Each of these four confederations operates their own Super League and they represent the second level of Jamaican football. The names of these four Super Leagues are: \n* KSAFA Super League \n* South Central Confederation Super League \n* Eastern Confederation Super League \n* Western Confederation Super League The winners of these leagues play off against each other, home and away, with the top two teams replacing the bottom two teams relegated from the Premier League. Teams relegated from the Premier League enter the Super League of the Confederation they belong to. The third level of Jamaican football is organised by the parish football associations. In the parishes of Kingston and St. Andrew, KSAFA has a third level league called the KSAFA Major League. For the remaining 12 parishes, the third level of football is represented by a major league competition in each parish organised by the parish FA to give 13 third level leagues. The champions of each parish are promoted to play in the super league of the confederation by right or by way off winning a play off against another parish champion(s) in the same confederation. At the fourth level of Jamaican football, KSAFA is represented by the KSAFA Syd Bartlett League. The other parishes have a Division One league to give 13 fourth Level leagues. Some parishes operate leagues at the fifth level. Promotion and relegation rules between leagues can vary due to the geographic nature of the league system.

Jared Eliot (November 7, 1685—April 22, 1763) was an American colonial minister, physician, agronomist and farmer. He was located in Guilford, Connecticut and wrote several articles on agriculture and animal husbandry as well as on the mineral qualities of Connecticut lands. He worked at the Yale Corporation (former name of the Yale University's board of trustees) from 1730 until 1763. Eliot was the eldest son of Joseph Eliot and his second wife, Mary Wyllys. The Eliots raised their family in Guilford (formerly known as Menunkatucket), which was settled by Europeans in 1639. Jared emulated his father and grandfather, who were also willing to help others; he stated, “I have learned many useful things from the lowest of the People, not only in Rank, but in Understanding too”.

John Underhill (7 October 1597 – 21 July 1672) was an early English settler and soldier in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, the Province of New Hampshire, where he also served as governor; the New Haven Colony, New Netherland, and later the Province of New York, settling on Long Island. Hired to train militia in New England, he is most noted for leading colonial militia in the Pequot War (1636–1637) and Kieft's War which the colonists mounted against two different groups of Native Americans. He also published an account of the Pequot War.

John Wheatley College was founded in 1989 and had its main campuses in Shettleston, Easterhouse and Haghill in Glasgow. The college originally opened in 1989 within the former main building of Eastbank Academy (which had moved to a brand new building in 1986) supporting learning throughout the communities of east Glasgow, working in partnership with the city council's community planning teams, with Glasgow Regeneration Agency and Glasgow Life, with local housing associations and voluntary organisations to provide neighbourhood learning centres connected to the wireless Glasgow East Learning Network, the twin hubs for which were its main campuses. The opening of the Haghill Campus in 2007 meant the closure of the Shettleston Campus, the former Eastbank Academy buildings now being used as office space. John Wheatley College provided courses in construction, hospitality, care, creative industries, art and computing, and provided outreach courses for adults across the Glasgow East Learning Network. It also ran a significant youth programme in the networked learning centres, and at the Bridge in Easterhouse, in partnership with voluntary and statutory youth work providers, supported by both the City Council and Glasgow Housing Association. The college also supported people recently arrived in Glasgow who spoke English as a second language. The college merged with Stow College and North Glasgow College on 1 November 2013 to form Glasgow Kelvin College.

Kasbah Gnawa (Arabic: قصبة ڭناوة), also referred to as: Kasbah of Gnaouas or Ismailian Kasbah is a kasbah located in the city of Salé in Morocco, and is the only one on the right bank of the Bou Regreg river. Nowadays, the kasbah is hosting a circus school called \"Shemsy's\", which is the national Moroccan circus school, and the only circus school in Morocco and the whole of Africa.

Keep Away, also called Monkey in the Middle, Piggy in the Middle, Pickle in a Dish, or Pickle in the Middle, or Monkey, is a children's game in which two or more players must pass a ball to one another, while a player in the middle attempts to intercept it. The game could be considered a reverse form of dodgeball, because instead of trying to hit people in the middle with the ball, players attempt to keep the ball away from them. The game is played worldwide.

The Kilwa Chronicle is a text, believed to be based on oral tradition, which describes the origins of the Swahili city-state of Kilwa, on an Indian Ocean island near the East African coast. It recounts the genealogy of the rulers of the Kilwa Sultanate. Two sources of the Chronicle exist: the Kitāb al-Sulwa in Arabic and a Portuguese version that is a section of the book Décadas da Ásia by the historian João de Barros. The genealogical account is similar in both versions but other details vary substantially.

The Laurel Hill Plantation in Adams County, Mississippi, about 12 miles (19 km) south of Natchez, Mississippi, is a historic Southern plantation. It was nominated for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, and was listed in 1982. The main house of the plantation no longer exists. The listing includes a historic brick church named St. Mary's Chapel (c. 1837) and a building from 1835 to 1840 which was a parsonage for the church, or was an outbuilding to the parsonage, and other outbuildings. It has been listed on the National Register since October 26, 1982.

Les petits riens (French for \"The Little Nothings\") is a ballet in one act and three tableaux by Jean-Georges Noverre, with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and other unknown composers, first performed at the Academie Royale de Music in Paris on 11 June 1778. The three tableaux are described in the Journal de Paris: 1. \n* l' Amour pris au filet et mis en cage. \"Love caught in a net and put in a cage\", performed by Mme Guimard, Auguste Vestris and a young child. 2. \n* Jeu de Colin-Maillard. The story of Jean Colin-Maillard was a legend about a warrior who fought on even with his eyes poked out. His name is the French word for the game Blind man's buff. The main role in this scene was performed by Jean Dauberval. Such playful scenery usually had flirtatious connotations, which is famously depicted by Fragonard in his painting Le Collin-Maillard. 3. \n* Espieglerie de l'Amour. \"Playfulness of love\" is a pastoral scene about a woman, played by Mlle Asselin, disguised as a male shepherd. Two other shepherdesses, performed by Mlles Guimard and Allard, fall in love with the shepherd. Finally, to disenchant the two shepherdesses the imposter ends up revealing her breasts to them. While Mozart was staying in Paris, Noverre asked him to compose a new score for a ballet that he had created in Vienna in 1767. The ballet was to be danced as an interlude in the new opera (1771) by Niccolò Piccinni. The opera was a flop and closed after four performances. Although the ballet music was well-received, Mozart was not credited with it, and he was at the time little known in Paris. The score, catalogued as K. Anh. 10/299b, was thought lost, but it was rediscovered in the Paris Opera's archives in the late 19th century and has since entered both the ballet and symphonic repertoire. The Passepied (nr. 11) in D major is reminiscent of the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Souvenir de Florence, Op. 70; a D minor version of the melody appears in bars 5 and 6. The motive derived from this is used throughout the piece.

The soundtrack for Little Miss Sunshine is a mix of indie rock and folk music. DeVotchKa provides the majority of the music on the soundtrack, and also the score, which they did with Mychael Danna. There are also selections from Sufjan Stevens, Rick James, and featured on the album. The song heard on the trailer featured on TV was \"Coming Home\" by The 88. The Internet trailer was accompanied by \"The Yeah Yeah Yeah Song (With All Your Power)\" by The Flaming Lips.

Lucius Verginius Rufus (AD 15 – 97; sometimes incorrectly called Lucius Virginus Rufus) was a Roman commander of Germania Superior during the late 1st century. He was three times consul (in 63, 69, and 97). He was born near Comum, the birthplace of both Pliny the Elder and Pliny the Younger. Verginius Rufus was born in Northern Italy as a member of an equestrian family. He became consul in 63 under the emperor Nero. After his consulship, Verginius Rufus was made governor of Germania Superior. When Gaius Iulius Vindex revolted against Nero in 67, Verginius Rufus led an army against him and defeated the rebel in 68 near modern-day Besançon. After Nero's fall, the legions under Verginius Rufus hailed him as emperor in preference to Servius Sulpicius Galba (Vindex' ally), but Verginius Rufus refused to accept the purple. After the death of Otho in April 69, the soldiers again offered the throne to Verginius, but he again refused it. Verginius retreated to an estate at Alsium on the coast of Etruria northwest of Rome. There he studied, composed poems, and had a literary salon. After the murder of Emperor Domitian, Marcus Cocceius Nerva was elected emperor by the senate. Nerva chose as his co-consul for 97 the elderly Verginius Rufus, who was enticed out of retirement. However, when Verginius Rufus was to hold a speech, he dropped a book he was carrying, and while bending down to pick it up, slipped and broke his hip. He died not long afterward at the age of 82 and was given a state funeral. At the public burial with which he was honored, the historian Tacitus (then consul) delivered the funeral oration. Pliny the Younger, his neighbor and ward, has recorded the lines which Verginius had ordered to be engraved upon his tomb: Hic situs est Rufus, pulso qui Vindice quondam Imperium asseruit non sibi sed patriae (\"Here lies Rufus, who after defeating Vindex, did not take power, but gave it to the fatherland\").

Lum v. Rice, 275 U.S. 78 (1927), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the exclusion on account of race of a child of Chinese ancestry from a public school did not violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The decision effectively approved the exclusion of any minority children from schools reserved for whites. The case was brought by the Lum family of Rosedale, Mississippi, Chinese immigrants with two American-born children who had attended local public schools for white children without incident until, in the wake of an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment nationwide after passage of the Immigration Act of 1924, they were told by administrators that their children could only attend the district's school for black children. Adrienne Berard points out in Water Tossing Boulders that their reason for choosing to avoid black schools was motivated by racism. In fact, Katherine Lum later told a reporter, “I did not want my children to attend the ‘colored’ schools [because] the community would have classified us as Negroes.” They filed suit in local court to force the district to allow their daughters to continue attending the white school. Earl Brewer, a former governor of the state, represented the Lums, arguing that forcing the girls to attend the inferior school violated their Fourteenth Amendment, and that since they were not Black they should be allowed to attend the schools for whites. He was able to win the writ of mandamus they sought, but then the school district appealed to the Mississippi Supreme Court, which heard the case en banc and unanimously reversed the lower court, holding that Mississippi's constitution and laws clearly distinguished Asians (\"Mongolians\", it called them) from whites, so the Lums could not attend white schools. The U.S. Supreme Court granted Brewer's certiorari petition to review the case. The case was never argued; instead just decided on its briefs, and the Lums' was so poor it led Justice Louis Brandeis to ask around if some other lawyer could be found on short notice to argue the case. Chief Justice William Howard Taft's short unanimous opinion ended with a pronouncement that all racial segregation in schools was constitutional; while it was overturned by Brown v. Board of Education a quarter-century later, it gave greater legal foundation to educational segregation in the short term and set back efforts to end it.

Madjid Fahem is a French guitarist born in Paris in 1973. He is member of Manu Chao band from 2000. He was born in the suburbs of Paris, of Algerian parents. At age 16, he took an old acoustic guitar from his father and started playing with his uncles. From there he did not separate from that instrument again. His musical role models include Django Reinhardt and Paco de Lucía, while Dire Straits and Eric Clapton influenced him in the early stages of his musical development. Fahem initially played with various local bands and then joined the formation \"La Kinky Beat\", until he joined in 2000 as a guitarist founded by Manu Chao band Radio Bemba. He joined several local groups before joining the group Radio Bemba in 2000, which accompanies singer-songwriter Manu Chao. He is known for his \"fire solos\", including the live version of \"Clandestino\". Play a Gibson SG for electric tracks, or a classical guitar for songs that sound rumba or traditional. Finally, Madjid was involved in the development of Manu Chao's latest album, La Radiolina of 2007. In addition to Chao, Fahem has collaborated in more than fifteen recordings of different artists. Manu Chao appreciates the collaboration with Fahem very much, in an interview he describes Fahem exuberantly as \"a monster, one of the best guitarists in the world\".

In archaeology and anthropology, a manuport is a natural object which has been moved from its original context by human agency but otherwise remains unmodified. The word derives from the Latin words manus, meaning \"hand\" and portare, meaning \"to carry\". Examples include stones or shells moved from coastal or riverine areas or pebbles found in alien geological contexts. Some have been attributed to early hominins applying significance to pleasingly shaped natural objects such as the Makapansgat pebble, as well as to later societies. The appearance of the oldest possible manuport, the Makapansgat pebble with distinctive \"staring eyes\" and facial features supposedly deposited by hominins in a dolerite cave in Makapansgat, South Africa, may date as early as 3,000,000 BP. Another possible manuport is the Erfoud manuport resembling a human phallus, found near Erfoud, Morocco, and dating 300,000-200,000 BP. No further research regarding these artifacts has been done so far, so it remains unclear whether they are indeed manuports or simply occurred in corresponding archeological deposits by chance. Manuports have also been used to support the theory of the Bering Land Bridge.

Maria Sterk (born 5 June 1979, in Hallum) is a Dutch marathon speed skater. In 2005, she finished in third position of the and on 11 February of that year she announced to attack the women's world hour speed skating record, which was held by at that time. On 30 March 2005, she broke the world record in the Thialf stadium of Heerenveen and set the distance at 36.441,26 metres. Starting with laps of 37 seconds she took an advantage of a minute over the former record before skating laps of 40 seconds. In the end her average laptime was 39.5 seconds, which was enough to break the record. The record set by van Tol was 34.507,30 metres. Sterk finished second in the . She was unable to win any of the races, but finished in second position in two races and gained enough points to claim the second place in the final rankings behind Daniëlle Bekkering, but in front of Elma de Vries. She also managed to claim one second and two third positions at the Essent Cup 2006–07, which is still running. She is currently found at the third spot behind Bekkering and de Vries.

The Michael Kelly Guitar Company is a US musical instrument company founded in 1999 and based in Clearwater, Florida.

The company has recently gained popularity, particularly due to the release of their new Mod Shop Guitars, where they take some of their standard designs and swap out the pickups using Lindy Fralin, Seymour Duncan, TV Jones, Bare Knuckle and Fishman. Michael Kelly gained popularity due to their Dragonfly II acoustic bass, which has been used by Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses, Shavo Odadjian of System of a Down, and Tony Bigley of Souls Harbor. Current line of products commercialised by Michael Kelly includes electric and acoustic guitars, basses, acoustic and electric mandolins.

A motherboard (also called mainboard, main circuit board, or mobo) is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in general-purpose computers and other expandable systems. It holds and allows communication between many of the crucial electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit (CPU) and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals. Unlike a backplane, a motherboard usually contains significant sub-systems, such as the central processor, the chipset's input/output and memory controllers, interface connectors, and other components integrated for general use. Motherboard means specifically a PCB with expansion capabilities. As the name suggests, this board is often referred to as the \"mother\" of all components attached to it, which often include peripherals, interface cards, and daughterboards: sound cards, video cards, network cards, host bus adapters, TV tuner cards, IEEE 1394 cards; and a variety of other custom components. Similarly, the term mainboard describes a device with a single board and no additional expansions or capability, such as controlling boards in laser printers, television sets, washing machines, mobile phones, and other embedded systems with limited expansion abilities.

Multilingualism is the use of more than one language, either by an individual speaker or by a group of speakers. It is believed that multilingual speakers outnumber monolingual speakers in the world's population. More than half of all Europeans claim to speak at least one language other than their mother tongue; but many read and write in one language. Always useful to traders, multilingualism is advantageous for people wanting to participate in globalization and cultural openness. Owing to the ease of access to information facilitated by the Internet, individuals' exposure to multiple languages is becoming increasingly possible. People who speak several languages are also called polyglots. Multilingual speakers have acquired and maintained at least one language during childhood, the so-called first language (L1). The first language (sometimes also referred to as the mother tongue) is usually acquired without formal education, by mechanisms about which scholars disagree. Children acquiring two languages natively from these early years are called simultaneous bilinguals. It is common for young simultaneous bilinguals to be more proficient in one language than the other. People who speak more than one language have been reported to be more adept at language learning compared to monolinguals. Multilingualism in computing can be considered part of a continuum between internationalization and localization. Due to the status of English in computing, software development nearly always uses it (but not in the case of non-English-based programming languages). Some commercial software is initially available in an English version, and multilingual versions, if any, may be produced as alternative options based on the English original.

The Department Of the Navy Acquisition Intern Program is a civilian (not active duty military) professional hiring program. The Naval Acquisition Career Center manages several hundred interns at any given time. The internship is two and one half years, but may vary in length depending on the program the intern applies for. The career fields available are Business/Cost Estimating and Financial Management, Contracting, Communications/Computer Systems, Acquisition Logistics, Systems Planning, Research, Development and Engineering, or Manufacturing, Production and Quality Assurance. This is an excepted service position. Interns can choose a variety of locations in which to live. While this program is designed for those just out of college that is certainly not the rule. There are many interns that are non-traditional and the Navy encourages veterans as well as non-veterans to apply for positions through this program. There are GPA requirements for each career field, see job descriptions below. Some internships require the completion of a senior project. The program has been converted from the General Schedule pay scale to the National Security Personnel System pay for performance. The 'Naval Acquisition Career Center bulletin board is the primary vehicle for collective communication to the intern workforce, their supervisors and the CFMs, as well as other interested parties.

A noise gate or gate is an electronic device or software that is used to control the volume of an audio signal. Comparable to a compressor, which attenuates signals above a threshold, such as loud attacks from the start of musical notes, noise gates attenuate signals that register below the threshold. However, noise gates attenuate signals by a fixed amount, known as the range. In its simplest form, a noise gate allows a main signal to pass through only when it is above a set threshold: the gate is \"open\". If the signal falls below the threshold, no signal is allowed to pass (or the signal is substantially attenuated): the gate is \"closed\". A noise gate is used when the level of the \"signal\" is above the level of the unwanted \"noise\". The threshold is set above the level of the \"noise\", and so when there is no main \"signal\", the gate is closed. A common application is with electric guitar to remove hum and hiss noise caused by distortion effects units. A noise gate does not remove noise from the signal itself; when the gate is open, both the signal and the noise will pass through. Even though the signal and the unwanted noise are both present in open gate status, the noise is not as noticeable. The noise becomes most noticeable during periods where the main signal is not present, such as a bar of rest in a guitar solo. Gates typically feature \"attack\", \"release\", and \"hold\" settings and may feature a \"look-ahead\" function.

Oleg Viktorovich Novitskiy (Russian: Олег Викторович Новицкий; born October 12, 1971 in Chervyen, Belarus) is a former Lieutenant Colonel in the Russian Air Force who logged over 700 hours of flight time and was awarded for bravery. He is currently serving as a Russian cosmonaut with Roscosmos and has participated in multiple expeditions, during which he has spent over 531 days in space.

The amago or the red-spotted masu salmon (Oncorhynchus masou macrostomus) is a salmonid fish endemic to western Japan, and a subspecies of the more widespread Northwest Pacific masu salmon or cherry salmon (Oncorhynchus masou). It is distinguished by the presence of red or vermilion spots on the body along with black ones, while the nominate form O. masou masou, known as the yamame, only has black ones. The amago is distributed in western Japan, on the Pacific side of the Honshu and Shikoku islands, and on the Inland Sea of Japan side of Kyushu. The subspecies is a subject of aquaculture. It can grow up to 50 cm (20 in) length. There are both anadromous (sea-run) and persistently stream-dwelling populations of the amago. Previously it was considered a subspecies of Oncorhynchus rhodurus, a name that currently only refers to the Biwa trout, which has a restricted distribution within the range of the amago.

Orzhytsia Raion (Ukrainian: Оржицький район) was a raion (district) in Poltava Oblast of central Ukraine. The raion's administrative center was the urban-type settlement of Orzhytsia. The raion was abolished and its territory was merged into Lubny Raion on 18 July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Poltava Oblast to four. The last estimate of the raion population was 22,741 (2020 est.)

Oude Westen (Old West) is a neighborhood of Rotterdam, Netherlands adjacent to the city center. The neighborhood was created in the late 19th century when the territory of the district belonged to the then municipality Delfshaven. Delfshaven put few demands on ground operators, which became a neighborhood filled with speculators construction. In 1886, because of the annexation of Delfshaven, Oude Westen became a part of Rotterdam. The municipality of Rotterdam applied a systemic approach regarding urban expansion of Delfshaven, which, among other things, caused paved roads and sewers in the neighborhood. As the city grew, the western part of the city reached to Schiedam. Since then the oldest part of district is called Oude Westen. Oude Westen is a neighborhood with two main roads: The West-Kruiskade, known for its Chinatown and the many shops where products or foodstuffs are sold from abroad, and Nieuwe Binnenweg, known for its cafes, coffee shops, nightclubs and foreign restaurants. Trams run by these two streets. Oude Westen is bordered on the western side by the Henegouwerlaan and 's-Gravendijkwal, on the eastern side by the Westersingel and by the northern and southern side the Weena and Rochussenstraat. In the neighborhood live people from many different nationalities: 70% of the shops are run by people of foreign origin. The neighborhood is known as pleasant to visit, but is considered, especially in the evening hours, as a \"problem neighborhood\". After the crime in the 1990s in this area greatly increased, the municipality of Rotterdam has taken several measures to improve the safety including drafting cameras.

Parijat (Nepali: पारिजात) was a Nepalese writer. Her real name was Bishnu Kumari Waiba (Waiba is a subgroup of Tamang) but she wrote under the pen name Parijat. Her most notable publication is Shiris Ko Phool for which she won the prestigious Madan Puraskar, becoming the first woman to receive the award. She published multiple novels and wrote many poems and stories in her lifetime. The English translation of Shiris ko Phool, The Blue Mimosa has been adapted in the literature curriculum of the University of Maryland.

In computer science, partial order reduction is a technique for reducing the size of the state-space to be searched by a model checking or Automated planning and scheduling algorithm. It exploits the commutativity of concurrently executed transitions, which result in the same state when executed in different orders. In explicit state space exploration, partial order reduction usually refers to the specific technique of expanding a representative subset of all enabled transitions. This technique has also been described as model checking with representatives. There are various versions of the method, the so-called stubborn set method, ample set method, and persistent set method.

Patsey (ca. 1830–after 1863) was an African-American enslaved woman. Solomon Northup wrote about her in his book Twelve Years a Slave, which is the source for most of the information known about her. The book was later adapted into a film, in which she was portrayed by Lupita Nyong'o, who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

Phu Quoc International Airport (Vietnamese: Sân bay quốc tế Phú Quốc or Cảng hàng không quốc tế Phú Quốc) (IATA: PQC, ICAO: VVPQ) is an international airport that was completed in 2012 on Phú Quốc Island, in southern Vietnam. The airport covers nearly 900ha in Duong To village, Phú Quốc city, Kiên Giang Province having been built at a cost of around VND 16.2 trillion (US$810 million) and is planned to be built in phases. The airport is 10 km from the previous Phu Quoc Airport, which it replaced.The airport was initially able to handle about 2.5 million passengers per annum, and the maximum capacity will be 7 million passengers per annum, with international destinations expected to include Singapore and Sihanoukville International Airport.The airport has a single 3000m runway, capable of handling aircraft like the Airbus A350 and Boeing 747.The construction was completed in November 2012 and was put into operation on 2 December 2012.The Vietnamese government expects the airport to facilitate the arrival of international tourists who are attracted to the island's beaches.

Physalis acutifolia is a species of flowering plant in the nightshade family known by the common names sharpleaf groundcherry and Wright's ground-cherry. It is native to the southwestern United States from California to Texas, and northern Mexico, where it can be found in many types of habitat, including disturbed areas. It is sometimes a weed when it springs up in agricultural fields, but it is generally not weedy in wild habitat. This is an annual herb producing a branching stem up to a meter tall. The lance-shaped to oval leaves are up to 12 cm long and have edges lined with shallow, smooth teeth. The herbage is coated thinly in hairs appressed flat against the surface. The flowers growing from the leaf axils are round and flat-faced and sometimes over 2 cm wide. They are white to pale yellow with wide, bright yellow centers. The five stamens are each tipped with an anther about 3 mm long. The star-shaped calyx of sepals at the base of the flower enlarges as the fruit develops, becoming an inflated, ribbed lantern-shaped structure about 2 cm long which contains the berry.

Roger de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Warwick (c. 1102 – 12 June 1153) was the elder son of Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick and Margaret (d. after 1156), daughter of Geoffroy, Count of Perche and Beatrix of Montdidier. He was also known as Roger de Newburgh. The borough of Warwick remembers him as the founder of the Hospital of S. Michael for lepers which he endowed with the tithes of Wedgnock, and other property; he also endowed the House of the Templars beyond the bridge. He also built the Chapel of St James the Great in Warwick which is now part of the Lord Leycester Hospital In the reign of King Stephen he founded a priory dedicated to S. Cenydd at Llangennith, Co. Glamorgan and he attached it as a cell to the Abbey of S. Taurinus at Evreux in Normandy.

Salterella is an enigmatic Cambrian genus with a small, conical, calcareous shell that appears to be septate, but is rather filled with stratified laminar deposits. The shell contains grains of sediment, which are obtained selectively (with a preference for denser grains) by a manner also observed in foramanifera. The genus was established by Elkanah Billings in 1861, and was named after the English palaeontologist John William Salter. The genus is known from multiple locations worldwide, such as Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec in Canada, Svalbard, the Scottish Highlands and Argentina. The related fossil genus Volborthella was formerly placed in synonymy with Salterella by Ellis L. Yochelson in 1983, due to the similarities between the two genera (though Volborthella notably lacks an outer calcareous shell). However, Volborthella was later accepted as a separate genus again by Yochelson & Kisselev in 2003. Both genera are currently placed in the Salterellidae family in the phylum Agmata.

Saunders Park is a neighborhood in the West Philadelphia section of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It is bounded by Powelton Avenue, 38th Street, Lancaster Avenue, and 40th Street.

Saunders Park is often considered to be a part of , which extends out to 42nd Street. The neighborhood has participated in planning for its future with the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission. The report of that plan is available here.

Schneller Orphanage, also called the Syrian Orphanage, was a German Protestant orphanage that operated in Jerusalem from 1860 to 1940. It was one of the first structures to be built outside the Old City of Jerusalem – the others being Kerem Avraham, the Bishop Gobat school, Mishkenot Sha’ananim, and the Russian Compound – and paved the way for the expansion of Jerusalem in the 19th century. As a philanthropic institution offering academic and vocational training to hundreds of orphaned and abandoned Arab children, it also exerted a strong influence on the Arab population of Jerusalem and the Middle East through its graduates, who spread its philosophies of \"orderliness, discipline, and German language\" throughout the region. The Syrian Orphanage was born out of South German Pietism, which combined Biblicism, idealism, and religious individualism. The orphanage provided both academic and vocational training to orphaned boys and girls from Palestine, Syria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Armenia, Turkey, Russia, Iran, and Germany, graduating students skilled in such trades as tailoring, shoemaking, engraving, carpentry, metalworking, pottery, painting, printing, farming, and gardening. In 1903 a school for the blind was opened on the premises, including dormitories, classrooms and vocational workshops. The orphanage also operated its own printing press and bindery; flour mill and bakery; laundry and clothing-repair service; carpentry; pottery factory; tree and plant nursery; and brick and tile factory. Located on high ground and surrounded by a high stone wall, the orphanage's distinctive onion-dome tower, multistory buildings, and decorative facades exuded the power and influence of European Christians in Jerusalem in the mid-19th century. Continuous building and land acquisitions increased the size of the orphanage grounds to nearly 150 acres (600 dunam) by World War I. At the beginning of World War II, the British mandatory government deported the German teachers and turned the compound into a closed military camp with the largest ammunition stockpile in the Middle East. On March 17, 1948, the British abandoned the camp and the Etzioni Brigade of the Haganah used it as a base of operations during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. For the next 60 years the site served as an Israeli army base known as Camp Schneller. The army vacated the premises in 2008. As of 2011, the compound is being developed for luxury housing. In 2015, remains of a Jewish settlement of the late Second Temple period were discovered at the site. In 2016, archaeologists unearthed an ancient Roman bathhouse and a large wine production facility.

A source port is a software project based on the source code of a game engine that allows the game to be played on operating systems or computing platforms with which the game was not originally compatible.

The Spanish bowline is a double loop knot that can be used to lift a person. For a conscious person, each loop is placed around a leg and the person holds onto the standing part of the rope. This knot can serve as a makeshift Bosun's chair. For an unconscious person one loop is placed around the arm pits and the second loop is placed around the knees. This knot has an elegant symmetry and can be tied quickly when mastered. Unlike the Portuguese bowline, each loop is separately fixed, which is a nice feature. It is a complicated knot however and if not properly tightened, it can slip. A fireman's chair knot is another double loop knot which is more practical, easier to tie and less prone to slipping although it lacks the elegance of a Spanish bowline. \n* From behind \n* From the front

The Standard Model of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (the electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions, while omitting gravity) in the universe, as well as classifying all known elementary particles. It was developed in stages throughout the latter half of the 20th century, through the work of many scientists around the world, with the current formulation being finalized in the mid-1970s upon experimental confirmation of the existence of quarks. Since then, confirmation of the top quark (1995), the tau neutrino (2000), and the Higgs boson (2012) have added further credence to the Standard Model. In addition, the Standard Model has predicted various properties of weak neutral currents and the W and Z bosons with great accuracy. Although the Standard Model is believed to be theoretically self-consistent and has demonstrated huge successes in providing experimental predictions, it leaves some phenomena unexplained and falls short of being a complete theory of fundamental interactions. It does not fully explain baryon asymmetry, incorporate the full theory of gravitation as described by general relativity, or account for the accelerating expansion of the universe as possibly described by dark energy. The model does not contain any viable dark matter particle that possesses all of the required properties deduced from observational cosmology. It also does not incorporate neutrino oscillations and their non-zero masses. The development of the Standard Model was driven by theoretical and experimental particle physicists alike. For theorists, the Standard Model is a paradigm of a quantum field theory, which exhibits a wide range of phenomena including spontaneous symmetry breaking, anomalies and non-perturbative behavior. It is used as a basis for building more exotic models that incorporate hypothetical particles, extra dimensions, and elaborate symmetries (such as supersymmetry) in an attempt to explain experimental results at variance with the Standard Model, such as the existence of dark matter and neutrino oscillations.

Stretford is a tram stop on the Altrincham Line of Greater Manchester's light-rail Metrolink system. It is located in Stretford, on the corner of Chester Road and Edge Lane. It opened on 15 June 1992 as part of Phase 1 of Metrolink's expansion. The stop was formerly Stretford railway station, a regional rail station which was opened by the Manchester South Junction and Altrincham Railway as Edge Lane railway station on 20 July 1849, was renamed to Stretford in September 1849, and closed on 24 December 1991 for conversion from heavy rail to light rail.

Svealandsbanan is the Swedish name of the Svealand Railway, which runs between Södertälje and Valskog (near Arboga) via Mariefred Läggesta, Strängnäs and Eskilstuna. The length is 115 kilometres (71 mi). The railway was opened between Södertälje and Eskilstuna in 1997. It replaced an older railway from 1895 with a different more curvy route. The part between Eskilstuna and Valskog was built in 1877. The railway Södertälje-Eskilstuna is built as a high-speed railway with gentle curves that is mainly single tracked. Today trains are allowed to run at 200 km/h, without needing tilting trains. The railway is single track with several kilometers long passing loops, kind of partial double track, allowing trains passing each other at speed, instead of one of them stopping to let the other pass. The railway has three double-track sections: between Nykvarn and Läggesta; between Strängnäs and Härad, completed in June 2018; and between Eskilstuna and Folkesta, an intermodal terminal in Eskilstuna Municipality. The passenger trains usually run between Stockholm and Arboga, but goes as far as Örebro in rush hour. From 2019, the new ER1 trains are used on all passenger services on the line. The number of passengers have greatly exceeded expectations and is often used as an example of what a modern railway can accomplish.

Tantamani (Ancient Egyptian: tnwt-jmn, Neo-Assyrian: Urdamanee, Ancient Greek: Τεμένθης Teménthēs), also known as Tanutamun or Tanwetamani (d. 653 BC) was a pharaoh of Ancient Egypt and the Kingdom of Kush located in Northern Sudan and a member of the Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt. His prenomen or royal name was Bakare, which means \"Glorious is the Soul of Re.\"

A Topfield Application Program (TAP) is a software application which extends the standard functionality of the Topfield products designed for digital TV. Examples of TAPs are electronic programme guides, digital photo viewers and MP3 players. Anyone with the necessary computer programming skills may create a TAP to meet their needs. This is possible because Topfield have specified an open (or public) API which allows TAPs to be created using the C or C++ programming languages. They can be installed into most Topfield PVR models. Some people have created TAPs and made them available for others to download and use, either free of charge or for a small fee. There are several internet forums dedicated to TAPs where information and support can be exchanged.

Training centre for release of the Atma-energy (German: Trainingszentrum zur Freisetzung der Atmaenergie), also known as Atman Foundation, was a new religious movement active mainly on the island of Tenerife and in Germany. and is known for a police and media scare in which an alleged attempt to commit ritual suicide took place in Teide National Park in Tenerife. Apparently, the 32 members of the sect believed that they would be collected by a spacecraft and taken to an unspecified destination. Failing that, they were believed to be going to commit suicide. However, more recent articles in Tenerife News and Diario de Avisos question this, saying there was no intention to commit suicide by the group. The Spanish media referred to the group as \"secta de Heide Fittkau\", after the name of its founder.

USV Eschen/Mauren is a Liechtensteiner football club from Eschen and Mauren. They play at the Sportpark Eschen-Mauren, which used to be the national football stadium, until the Rheinpark Stadion in Vaduz was built. USV Eschen/Mauren, like all other Liechtensteiner teams, play in the Swiss Football League system. The first team plays in 1. Liga, Group 3, the fourth tier of the Swiss Football League, following promotion in the 2007/08 season from 2.Liga interregional as a result of winning the Group 5 division. The club was originally formed in 1963 as a merger of FC Mauren and FC Eschen. Since 1975, the first team has always played in Liga 2 except for the 1999/2000 season when they were promoted to 1. Liga, Group 3 before being relegated back again to 2.Liga interregional. After the 2007/08 season, it won promotion once again. USV has won the Liechtensteiner Cup on five occasions, the most recent being in 2012, and 17 occasions have been runners-up.

Ultra Fight Victory (ウルトラファイトビクトリー, Urutora Faito Bikutorī) is a Japanese television miniseries produced by Tsuburaya Productions, aired during the ending segment of the New Ultraman Retsuden programming block on TV Tokyo. The official YouTube Channel of Tsuburaya Productions aired this miniseries legally with each episode that was uploaded to the Tsuburaya Productions YouTube Channel being deleted a week after their initial upload. It was available in regions that are currently region locked such as the United States. In promotion to the 2-part episodes 13 and 14 of Ultraman X, which features the crossover with the cast of Ultraman Ginga S, the Tsuburaya YouTube channel decided to re-aired a full episode instead of miniseries cuts, retaining the original subtitle. However, this video (like the first miniseries cut) was limited until it would be locked in October 24, 2015. A DVD release of the miniseries was sold online and pre-orders were available to be made on the Japanese site of Amazon.com until December 16, 2015.\\ Currently a newly released English dub of Ultra Fight Victory is airing on Tsuburaya Productions’s YouTube Channel. This new dub is a joint effort between William Winckler Productions and Tsuburaya Productions. The new president of Tsuburaya Productions stated that trying to introduce a foreign audience such as the West to Ultraman would prove to be quite difficult. It is not impossible as he stated that making a new Ultraman with homages to past Ultramans to appeal to foreign audiences is indeed possible. However, Ultra Fight Victory is not a new property. What seems to have occurred is that Tsubruaya Productions has drastically changed their plans to appeal to international audiences. This new English dub of Ultra Fight Victory is a new venture in Tsuburaya Productions’s efforts to appeal to those who use online content and streaming platforms in foreign countries.

WSHF (94.5 FM, \"The Voice of The Shoals\") is a radio station licensed to serve . The station is owned by NAHF Inc. It airs a heavy schedule of local news, traffic, and weather information. The station was assigned the WSHF-LP call letters by the Federal Communications Commission on February 17, 2014. The WSHF call letters were originally assigned to AM 1380 in Sheffield, owned by Daylight Broadcasting. This first WSHF was founded by Dick Biddle, who surrendered the station's license to purchase WOWL 1240 in 1952. The WSHF call letters were later used by AM 1290 in Sheffield from 1963 to 1985, when it became WHCM. In 2014, the WSHF calls were resurrected for use on 92.3 FM, a station which originally signed on the air in Muscle Shoals on October 31, 2007. The station rebroadcast WLAY AM 1450's all-Muscle Shoals music format until 2012. During that time, Licensee URBan Radio Broadcasting dropped the WLAY call letters in favor of positioning the combo as \"1450 & 92.3 The Sound.\" URBan lost the license for 92.3 FM in 2012, and AM 1450 went silent in December 2014. With WSHF 92.3 FM's sign-on in June 2015, the station continued a tradition of broadcasting that dates all the way back to November 1933 when 1450's predecessor WNRA 1420 signed on the air in Sheffield. On October 1, 2019 WSHF announced it would move up the FM dial from 92.3 to 94.5 FM. The station cited continued interference from a co-channel station in Tennessee as the reason for its move up the FM dial.

State Route 31 (SR 31) is a Washington state highway located entirely in Pend Oreille County. The highway, which is 26.79 miles (43.11 km) long, starts at an intersection with SR 20 in Tiger and travels north to the Canada–US border north of Metaline Falls. At the border, SR 31 becomes British Columbia Highway 6 (BC 6). The route parallels the Pend Oreille River for most of its route and the primary functions of the highway is to serve and connect Tiger, Ione, Metaline and Metaline Falls with British Columbia. Before 1964, the route from Newport to BC 6 was the northernmost section of Primary State Highway 6, which ran from Spokane to BC 6. Originally created in 1964, SR 31 extended southeast to an intersection with U.S. Route 2 (US 2, formerly US 195) in Newport. The North Cascades Highway (SR 20) was extended to Newport in 1973 and SR 31 from Newport to Tiger became SR 20. SR 31 had one auxiliary route, SR 311, which became SR 211 after SR 20 was extended.

Wayoró (also Wayoro, Ajurú, Wajuru; Wayoró: wayoro emẽto [βajoˈɾo ɛmɛ̃ˈto]) is a moribund Tuparian language (Tupian family), which is spoken in the state of Rondônia, in the Amazon region of Brazil. As of 2019, there were reported to be 3 speakers (all above 70 years old) and 11 semispeakers out of the ethnic population of approximately 250.

Wolf Krakowski (born 1947) is a Polish-Canadian Yiddish-speaking songwriter, singer, and guitarist. He was born at , an Austrian camp for displaced persons, where his parents, who were Polish Jews who survived the Holocaust in Russia, lived for a short while after World War II. Soon afterwards they moved to Sweden, and the small town of Eskilstuna, where the family stayed until 1954 when they moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada. As a young man Krakowski took to the road, working with the Conklin and Garrett Shows carnival and later toured for some time with blues-singer Big Joe Williams. He worked with street theatre, and as a carpenter and guitar-builder for many years. In 1994-1995 he worked as a videographer for the Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation, documenting the testimonies of over one hundred Holocaust survivors. In 1996 he released the CD Transmigrations/Gilgul on his own record label, Kame'a Media. On this record he presented traditional Yiddish songs in a blues–rock–reggae vein. Among the traditional songs and credited compositions Krakowski reshaped here were: Shabes, Shabes, Friling (Springtime) and Zol Shoyn Kumen Di Geule (Let the Redemption Come), all sung by Krakowski in his first language, Yiddish. On this record, and on those that followed, he was accompanied by , starring roots-rock veterans, multi-instrumentalist and bass guitarist Ray Mason. Krakowski made a considerable impact in world music circles with this record, and the rights to it were taken over some years later by the well-known avant-garde recording company Tzadik, led by saxophonist John Zorn, who in 2002 released Krakowski's second CD in Yiddish: Goyrl: Destiny. Between these records, Krakowski himself also released the CD Unbounded (on Kamea Media), on which he sings some of his own songs in English. In 2006, Krakowski and Jim Armenti produced the CD \"Di Alte Kashe\" (The Eternal Question: Fraidy Katz Sings Yiddish), also on Kame'a Media. Krakowski lives in Northampton, Massachusetts, United States.

The X-Men are a fictional team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, first appearing in The X-Men #1 by artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby and writer/editor Stan Lee in 1963. Although initially cancelled in 1970, following its 1975 revival and subsequent direction under writer Chris Claremont, it became one of the most recognizable and successful franchises of Marvel Comics. They have appeared in numerous books, television shows, films, and video games. The X-Men title may refer to the superhero team itself, the eponymous comic series, or the broader franchise including various solo titles and team books such as the New Mutants, Excalibur, and X-Force. In the Marvel Universe, mutants are humans who are born with a genetic trait called the X-gene which grants them natural superhuman abilities. Due to their differences from the majority of humanity, mutants are subject to prejudice and discrimination and many X-Men stories feature social commentary on bigotry and justice. The X-Men have fought against a variety of enemies, including villainous mutants, human bigots, mystical threats, extraterrestrials, and malevolent artificial intelligences. In most iterations of the team, they are led by their founder Charles \"Professor X\" Xavier, a powerful telepath who runs a school for mutant children out of his mansion in Westchester, New York, which secretly is also the headquarters of the X-Men. Their stories have frequently involved Magneto, a powerful mutant with control over magnetic fields, who is depicted as an old friend of and foil to Xavier, variously acting as an adversary or as an ally. The current iteration of the official X-Men team is headquartered in The Treehouse, a Krakoan base in New York City. No longer working in secret, they fight publicly for the safety of mutants, to build bridges between Krakoa and human nations, and to protect the Earth and Solar System from extraterrestrial threats.
