The 1997–1998 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series was a series of stages where events in men's and women's artistic gymnastics were contested. The International Gymnastics Federation revived the World Cup, an event which was not held since 1990, as a two-year long competition, culminating at a final event — the World Cup Final in 1998. A number of qualifier stages were held. The top 3 gymnast in each apparatus at the qualifier events would receive medals and prize money. Gymnasts who finished in the top 8 would also receive points that would be added up to a ranking which would qualify individual gymnasts for the biennial World Cup Final.

The 2019–20 Portland Trail Blazers season was the franchise's 50th season in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Trail Blazers entered the season following a playoff defeat from the Golden State Warriors in the Western Conference Finals. The season was suspended by the league officials following the games of March 11 after it was reported that Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19. On June 4, the Trail Blazers were one of 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble. On August 15, the Portland Trail Blazers clinched the 8th seed after defeating the Memphis Grizzlies in a play-in game. With the Blazers clinching a playoff berth, this was the 3rd consecutive season where 4 of 5 teams in the Northwest Division clinched the playoffs.

Iga Świątek defeated Sofia Kenin in the final, 6–4, 6–1 to win the Women's Singles tennis title at the 2020 French Open. This was Świątek's first Grand Slam title and first WTA singles title overall, making her the first player since Jeļena Ostapenko to win a major tournament as their maiden singles title. Ranked world No. 54, Świątek became the lowest-ranked player to win the French Open since rankings were introduced in 1975, and the lowest-ranked player to win a major title since Sloane Stephens won the 2017 US Open. Świątek also became the first Polish player to win a major singles title. At 19 years and 4 months of age, Świątek became the youngest woman to win the French Open singles title since Monica Seles in 1992. She did not drop a set throughout the entire tournament, dropping only 28 games in total, the fewest since Steffi Graf dropped 20 games in 1988. This also marked the first French Open where both the men's and women's singles champions did not drop a set during the tournament. Świątek became the first female Polish player since Jadwiga Jędrzejowska in 1939 to reach a French Open final, and the first to reach any major final since Agnieszka Radwańska at the 2012 Wimbledon Championships. Ashleigh Barty was the defending champion, but chose not to participate due to safety concerns resulting from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This marked the first time since 2008 that the defending French Open champion did not participate, and the second consecutive major tournament where the defending champion did not participate, after Bianca Andreescu withdrew from the 2020 US Open. Barty and Simona Halep were in contention for the WTA No. 1 singles ranking. Barty retained the top ranking when Halep lost to Świątek in the fourth round, ensuring a year-end No. 1 ranking for the second consecutive year. Halep's loss guaranteed a new French Open champion for the fifth consecutive year, and a maiden Grand Slam finalist from the top half of the draw. Serena Williams was attempting to add to her Open Era record of 23 major singles titles and equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 major singles titles, but withdrew before her second round match due to a left Achilles injury she suffered at the US Open. Only 13 of the 32 seeded players advanced to the third round, the fewest at any major since Wimbledon expanded to 32 seeds in 2001. Only three seeded players advanced to the quarterfinals, the fewest since the 1978 Australian Open. This was the first Grand Slam tournament since the 1999 Wimbledon Championships that two qualifiers, Nadia Podoroska and Martina Trevisan, reached the quarterfinals. The semifinal match between Świątek and Podoroska was also the first semifinal to be contested by two unseeded players at a Grand Slam since the 1983 French Open. Podoroska became the first qualifier in history to reach the semifinals of the French Open and the first to reach the semifinals at any major tournament since Alexandra Stevenson at the 1999 Wimbledon Championships. She also became the first female Argentine player since Paola Suárez in 2004 to reach the quarterfinals of a major tournament in singles, and the lowest-ranked semifinalist (ranked No. 130) at any Grand Slam since Henin at the 2010 Australian Open.

The 407th Air Refueling Squadron is an inactive United States Air Force unit. It was last assigned to the 42nd Bombardment Wing at Loring Air Force Base, Maine, where it was inactivated on 1 October 1990. The first predecessor of the squadron was activated as the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron in March 1942. It was redesignated the 407th Bombardment Squadron the following month. After participating in the antisubmarine campaign while training, it moved to the United Kingdom, where it participated in the strategic bombing campaign against Germany. It earned a Distinguished Unit Citation for its actions. After V-E Day, it moved to France, where it was inactivated in 1946. The 407th Air Refueling Squadron was activated in 1953 and supported Strategic Air Command's fighter units and bomber units until inactivating in 1961. It was activated again in 1962. The two units were consolidated in 1985.

In economics, insurance, and risk management, adverse selection is a market situation where buyers and sellers have different information. The result is that participants with key information might participate selectively in trades at the expense of other parties who do not have the same information. In an ideal world, buyers should pay a price which reflects their willingness to pay and the value to them of the product or service, and sellers should sell at a price which reflects the quality of their goods and services. For example, a poor quality product should be inexpensive and a high quality product should have a high price. However, when one party holds information that the other party does not have, they have the opportunity to damage the other party by maximising self-utility, concealing relevant information, and perhaps even lying. Taking advantage in an economic contract or trade of possession of undisclosed information is known as adverse selection. This opportunity has secondary effects: the party without the information can take steps to avoid entering into an unfair (maybe \"rigged\") contract, perhaps by withdrawing from the interaction, or a seller (buyer) asking a higher (lower) price, thus diminishing the volume of trade in the market. Furthermore, it can deter people from participating in the market, leading to less competition and thus higher profit margins for participants. Sometimes the buyer may know the value of a good or service better than the seller. For example, a restaurant offering \"all you can eat\" at a fixed price may attract customers with a larger than average appetite, resulting in a loss for the restaurant. A standard example is the market for used cars with hidden flaws (\"lemons\"). George Akerlof in his 1970 paper, \"The Market for 'Lemons'\", highlights the effect adverse selection has in the used car market, creating an imbalance between the sellers and the buyers that may lead to a market collapse. The paper further describes the effects of adverse selection in insurance as an example of the effect of information asymmetry on markets, a sort of \"generalized Gresham's law\". Since then, \"adverse selection\" has been widely used in many domains. The theory behind market collapse starts with consumers who want to buy goods from an unfamiliar market. Sellers, who do have information about which good is high or poor quality, would aim to sell the poor quality goods at the same price as better goods, leading to a larger profit margin. The high quality sellers now no longer reap the full benefits of having superior goods, because poor quality goods pull the average price down to one which is no longer profitable for the sale of high quality goods. High quality sellers thus leave the market, thus reducing the quality and price of goods even further. This market collapse is then caused by demand not rising in response to a fall in price, and the lower overall quality of market provisions. Sometimes the seller is the uninformed party instead, when consumers with undisclosed attributes purchase goods or contracts that are priced for other demographics. Adverse selection has been discussed for life insurance since the 1860s, and the phrase has been used since the 1870s.

Alan John Brown AM (born 25 January 1946) is a former Australian politician who served as a Liberal member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, and Leader of the Opposition from 1989 to 1991. A local businessman before entering politics, Brown entered the Legislative Assembly at the 1979 election as the Liberal member for Westernport, in western Gippsland, easily defeating Doug Jennings who had been expelled from the Liberal Party in 1977. He would hold this seat, renamed Gippsland West, until his retirement from politics in 1996. Brown served on the backbench during the Hamer and Thompson governments. After the Liberals lost government at the 1982 election Brown was promoted to the shadow ministry where he served as Shadow Minister for Youth, Sport and Education, Shadow Minister for Housing and Aboriginal Affairs and Shadow Minister for Transport under the leadership of Jeff Kennett. However, after the Liberals were narrowly defeated at the 1988 election many Liberals became unhappy with Kennett's leadership. Soon after the election, Kennett was deposed in a party room coup, and Brown was elected to succeed him. While Brown failed to take full advantage of the various crises involving the Labor government, he did successfully negotiate a Coalition agreement with the Nationals with whom relations were traditionally poor in Victoria. The Liberals had come up five seats short of winning the 1988 election, and it was thought that they would have won if not for a number of three-cornered contests in rural areas. In 1991, Kennett's followers, with Kennett's tacit support, organised a party room coup against Brown. When the spill motion carried, Brown opted not to recontest, allowing Kennett to retake the leadership unopposed. As a concession to Brown, Kennett kept him on the frontbench. After the Liberals were returned to power after the 1992 election Brown served as Minister for Public Transport. In late 1996 the Kennett Government appointed him as Agent General for Victoria. The resulting by-election in his then-safe seat of Gippsland West was won by Independent Labor candidate Susan Davies who would go on to play a decisive role in defeating the Kennett government. Brown remains prominent in his local community and unsuccessfully ran for the (Hovell Ward) in 2012.

André Durand (born 1947 in Ottawa, Ontario) is a Canadian painter working in the European Hermetic tradition. He is influenced by artists such as Rubens, Titian, Michelangelo and Velázquez. Although Durand is perhaps best known for his allegorical portraits, such as Princess Diana as Fortuna, he achieved international artistic acclaim for his official portraits of John Paul II (1983) and the 14th Dalai Lama (1982, 1983, 1989). Durand's portrait of the Irish novelist Elizabeth Bowen (1972) is one of the most popular portraits in London's National Portrait Gallery. In 1970 Durand painted a series of pictures inspired by the dancers of the Royal Ballet. It is nevertheless Durand's extraordinary mythological narratives that demonstrate his profound understanding of the myths and rituals of both Classical and Christian traditions. These are an ever-present undercurrent of his work. From May to October 2006, a major exhibition of paintings, Durand Wholly Pictures, was displayed in Sussex cathedrals and churches. This series of pictures, painted between 2000 and 2006, depicts Christian narratives set against the Sussex countryside. Durand recognizes that the need is greater today than ever before for artists to take up devotional subjects in painting. Durand paints his sacred subjects for the benefit of those who are not satisfied by postmodern fashions in this post secular era as much as for churchgoers. The Coronation of the Virgin, Stopham Bridge, Pulborough, 2006. November 1, 2007, marked the 20th anniversary of the unveiling of Durand's Votive Offering, which was painted to launch and benefit the AIDS charity Crusaid in 1987. A unique on-line exhibition about Votive Offering, its sources, and Durand's allegorical pictures of Diana, Princess of Wales, is to be found in Durand Gallery Exhibitions. On November 29, 2007, a new picture, Daniel in the Lions' Den is to be unveiled. The picture, and the Idea Fine Art limited edition prints of the picture, each signed and numbered by the artist, is to be benefit Demelza Hospice Care for Children. As Durand has said: 'almost all the young people that inspire me to paint them have something in common. I am convinced that I have met them before in a painting. When I consider the teenage behavior of the deities and saints in mythology or the Bible, not to mention heroes and heroines, the kids in my pictures are appropriate symbols of such protagonists.' How suitable therefore, for Durand to have represented the bravery of Daniel confronting death amongst the lions as a tribute to Demelza's dedication and sensitivity to the uniqueness of the physical, social, intellectual, emotional, cultural and spiritual needs of every child and their family. In 2011 after his return to Italy and particularly Torre del Greco and Sperlonga we witness a new period in André Durand's artistic trajectory fully manifest, first in the pictures he painted in Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Sperlonga where Durand held an open studio for almost two years as artist in residence and later in Fondi. At the invitation of doctor Marina Sapelli Ragni, Soprintendente per i Beni Archeologici della Regione Lazio and the director and personnel of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale di Sperlonga from 2010-2012 the artist began a body of work, including a series of tondi (round format paintings) on the subject of the Via Lucis. These pictures were finished in the Palazzo Caetani in 2013. The famous Grotto of Tiberius can be seen in the background of five of the six tondos. One painting Brother Carlo saving the Head of Ulysses was painted for the exhibition Dialogues with the Antique - Dialoghi con l'Antico curated by the archaeologist and author Marina Sapelli Ragni at the Villa Adriana, Tivoli in 2011. Durand's vision of a monk who stoically rescues the severed head of Odysseus. 2012 also saw the publication of several books of Durand's photographs. Notably, Photographing Statues for a Year, photographs the artist took of the statues in the museum from every point of view and in every imaginable lighting conditions. The text was co-written by the museum's director, Marisa de'Spagnolis and published by L'Erma di Bretschneider, and is the only comprehensive archive of photographs of the museum's collection, including two dozen photographs of the celebrated Head of Ulysses that bring the statue (on special loan to the Scuderie del Quirinale, Augustus exhibition October–January 2014) to life.

Barren vegetation describes an area of land where plant growth may be sparse, stunted, and/or contain limited biodiversity. Environmental conditions such as toxic or infertile soil, high winds, coastal salt-spray, and climatic conditions are often key factors in poor plant growth and development. Barren vegetation can be categorized depending on the climate, geology, and geographic location of a specific area. Pine barrens, coastal barrens, and serpentine barrens are some of the more distinct ecoregions for barren vegetation and are the most commonly researched by scientists. Often referred to as \"heathlands\", barrens can be excellent environments for unique biological diversity and taxonomic compositions.

Charles Sherrod (born 1937) is an activist who was born in Surry, Virginia and was raised by his Baptist grandmother. When he was a young boy he sang in a choir and attended Sunday school at a Baptist church. When he was older he became a preacher at Mount Olivet Baptist Church where he often preached to children. Sherrod is not only a preacher, but an activist. Charles Sherrod first took part in the Civil Rights Movement after the Supreme Court desegregated schools in the Brown v. Board of Education case. In 1954, Sherrod first participated in sit-ins at white churches with the goal to desegregate them. He was a key member and organizer of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the Civil Rights Movement. He became the first SNCC field secretary and SNCC director of southwest Georgia. His leadership there led to the Albany Movement. He also participated in the Selma Voting Rights Movement and in many other arenas of the 1960s movement era. However, Sherrod's activism continued throughout his life through the Southwest Georgia Project for Community Education (SWGAP), New Communities, and as an Albany City Council Member. He is married to former U.S. Department of Agriculture official Shirley Sherrod (married in 1966), who assisted with the Albany Movement and with SWGAP. Together they had two children. A supporter of racial integration, he recruited white as well as black members to assist with voter registration efforts. In 1966, he left the SNCC after its recently elected chairman Stokely Carmichael expelled white members. He moved north, to New York City, where he received his master's degree in sacred theology from the Union Theological Seminary. He then returned home to direct the Southwest Georgia Project for Community Education with Shirley Sherrod. In 1969, Sherrod, his wife Shirley, and some other members of the Albany Movement helped pioneer the land trust movement in the U.S., co-founding New Communities, a collective farm in Southwest Georgia modeled on kibbutzim in Israel. He later served as an elected member of the Albany City Council from 1976 to 1990. In his more recent years Charles Sherrod is known as a former chaplain at the Georgia State Prison in Homerville, and as a former teacher at Albany State University.

In the study of the classic Chinese novel Dream of the Red Chamber, the Cheng-Gao versions or Cheng-Gao editions (程高本) refer to two illustrated, woodblock print editions of the book, published in 1791 and 1792, both entitled The Illustrated Dream of the Red Chamber (绣像红楼梦). The 1791 version, produced at the year's end, was the novel's earliest print edition. A revised edition, differing in minor details, was published less than eighty days after the first print edition in early 1792. Both editions were edited by Cheng Weiyuan (程伟元) and Gao E and were published by Suzhou's Cuiwen Book House (萃文书屋). The Cheng-Gao versions differed from earlier scribal copies, which were titled The Story of the Stone 石头记). Cheng and Gao removed commentaries made by Zhiyanzhai, added illustrations, and changed the title. They made extensive edits, most important adding 40-chapters, which they claimed Cao had written to bring the novel to a close. Their edition is known as the Cheng-Gao continuation, . This 40-chapter ending is now the continuation read by most readers. Hu Shih in the 1920s referred to the 1791 version as the Chengjia edition (程甲本, \"Cheng-A book\") and the 1792 version as the Chengyi edition (程乙本, \"Cheng-B book\"). These remain the names they are known in the field of Redology. From the mid-20th century until the 1980s the Chengyi edition was the most read, studied and reprinted Dream version in Taiwan owing to Hu Shih's influence. In China, the People's Literature Publishing House (人民文学出版社) published an annotated 1982 edition based on the Rouge versions, effectively ending the era where the Cheng-Gao versions were used extensively. The 1982 People's Literature Publishing House edition was edited by a team of scholars from the \"Red Chamber Dream Academy\" (红楼梦研究所), which included influential Redologist Feng Qiyong (冯其庸). This 1982 edition was subsequently revised in 2008 and 2015. Original Cheng-Gao editions are now very rare and are highly prized collector's items – less than twenty copies are believed to be extant.

Collar rot is a symptomatically described disease that is usually caused by any one of various fungal and oomycete plant pathogens. It is present where the pathogen causes a lesion localized at or about the collet between the stem and the root. The lesions develop around the stem eventually forming a \"collar\". Observationally, collar rot grades into \"basal stem rot\", and with some pathogens is the first phase of \"basal stem rot\" often followed by \"root rot\". Collar rot is most often observed in seedings grown in infected soil. The pathogens that cause collar rot may be species or genera specific. But generalist pathogens such as Athelia rolfsii (aka Sclerotium rolfsii) are known to attack over 200 different species. While bacteria caused collar rot is not common, trees infected with Fire blight (Erwinia amylovora) may develop collar rot. Non-parasitic collar rot may be caused by winter damage. The symptomatically described disease Southern blight is often the first observed precursor of the collar rot caused by the fungus Athelia rolfsii. Causally known as Sclerotial blight, Athelia rolfsii survives in the soil as sclerotia, and in infected decomposing plant material as mycelia. Collar rot that is caused by the oomycete Phytophthora is causally called Phytophthora collar rot, and is a common disease of fruit and nut trees, as well as other flowers and crops. Phytophthora species remain in the soil, as spores, and in infected plant tissue, as mycelia, so absent control measures (sterilization, toxic applications) the disease continues so long as susceptible plants are grown in that soil.

Defrosted is the second album by American rock band Frijid Pink. Released in the summer of 1970, the album is more blues-based hard rock than its predecessor, yet still contains the characteristic fuzz guitar sound featured prominently on the group's first album, Frijid Pink. This is the last album to feature Kelly Green (Tom Beaudry) and Gary Ray Thompson; their departure from the group soon followed, fueled by an ego-driven notion that 'they' were Frijid Pink. The band were on the brink of major success at that time, but this breach of contract essentially ruined their chances. The LP reached only #149 on U.S. charts, although the debut one reached #11; the track \"Sing A Song For Freedom\" as a single made #55 in the US in July 1970 and #22 in Canada that September where the LP reached #54.German CD release (1997, Repertoire Records) includes four bonus tracks taken from 1971 and 1972 singles.

Dialommus fuscus, the Galápagos four-eyed blenny, is a species of labrisomid blenny endemic to the coasts of the Galapagos Islands. It inhabits the intertidal zone where it lives in tide pools as well as traveling on land. Special adaptations of the corneas of the eye and the gill filaments allow this species to travel up to 30 metres (98 ft) from the ocean in search of prey items such as insects and shore-dwelling crabs.

Epipremnum aureum is a species in the arum family Araceae, native to Mo'orea in the Society Islands of French Polynesia. The species is a popular houseplant in temperate regions but has also become naturalised in tropical and sub-tropical forests worldwide, including northern South Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia, South Asia, the Pacific Islands and the West Indies, where it has caused severe ecological damage in some cases. The plant has a number of common names including golden pothos, Ceylon creeper, hunter's robe, ivy arum, house plant, money plant, silver vine, Solomon Islands ivy, marble queen, and taro vine. It is also called devil's vine or devil's ivy because it is almost impossible to kill and it stays green even when kept in the dark. It is sometimes mistakenly labeled as a Philodendron in plant stores. It is commonly known as a money plant in many parts of the Indian subcontinent. It rarely flowers without artificial hormone supplements; the last known spontaneous flowering in cultivation was reported in 1964. The plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Expeditie Robinson: 2003, was the fourth Dutch/Belgian version of the Swedish show Expedition Robinson, or Survivor as it is referred to in some countries. This season began airing on September 13, 2003 and concluded on December 6, 2003. The major twist this season was that the team tribes were divided up by gender with the Timo tribe (South Team) initially being composed of seven males and one female, while the Pantai tribe (North Team) was composed of seven females and one male. As the only member of their gender on their respective tribes, Björn Lemeire and Fatima Aboulouafa were made leaders of their tribes and given immunity at their tribes first tribal council. A shocking discovery was made in episode 4 when Fatima was forced to leave the competition as it had been discovered that she was four months pregnant. In the same episode a tribal swap took place in which Giovani Oosters and Judge Chambliss from the Pantai tribe and Jutta Borms and Karen Vanautgaerden swapped tribes. In episode 7, the two tribes merged into a new tribe called Kelapa. Another twist occurred in episode 7 when following the merge and Karen's elimination, she was told that instead of just being eliminated all eliminated from then on would face off at \"Devils Island\", where they would take part in a series of duels. The winner of the final duel would then re-enter the game at the final three. The winner of the final duel was Ilona Laan. Ultimately, it was Jutta Borms from Belgium who won the season over Judge Chambliss from the Netherlands with an initial jury vote of 4-4, which was eventually broken by a public jury vote in which the public voted in favor of making Jutta the winner with 66% of the vote.

Ezekiel Pickens (March 30, 1768 – May 22, 1813) was an American lawyer and politician; he served as the Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina from 1802 to 1804. Pickens was the second of twelve children of General Andrew Pickens (1739-1817) and his wife Rebecca (Calhoun). Ezekiel was born at the family home near Abbeville, South Carolina; the family moved to the Hopewell plantation by 1785 (near the modern site of Clemson University), where Ezekiel was tutored in preparation for college. Pickens graduated third in his class at Princeton in 1790 and gave the valedictorian's address. Returning to South Carolina, Pickens studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1793. A member of the Democratic-Republican Party, he represented the Pendleton District in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1791-4 and St. Thomas and St. Denis parishes in 1801 and 1802. Pickens served as lieutenant governor of South Carolina from 1802 to 1804 under governor James Burchill Richardson.

Flare is the angle at which a ship's hull plate or planking departs from the vertical in an outward direction with increasing height. A flared hull typically has a deck area larger than its cross-sectional area at the waterline. Most vessels have some degree of flare above the waterline, which is especially true for sea vessels. Advantages of hull flare can include improvements in stability, splash and wash suppression, and dockside utility. Flare can also induce instability when it raises the center of gravity and lateral torque moment of a vessel too much (by negatively impacting its righting moment and metacentric height). Tumblehome is the inverse of flare, where the hull becomes narrower with increasing height.

Fradswell is a village in Staffordshire, England, approximately 7 miles (10 km) north-east of the town of Stafford and 7 miles (11 km) north of Colwich. Fradwell was first mentioned as part of the Colwich parish in the Domesday Book, where it is listed as Frodawelle or Frodeswelle, and it is likely to have been an Anglian settlement established during the Dark Ages. The village received a church of its own in the 13th century, when the Chapel of Saint James The Less was established. The chancel survives, but the main part of the church was rebuilt in 1764. Fradswell became a parish in its own right in February 1851 (it has since become the Milwich with Fradswell Parish), and further refurbishment, including the building of a new nave and the installation of stained glass by William Wailes, followed soon after. At this time it had 237 inhabitants and 1,100 acres (4.5 km2) of land. Fradswell in 2021 is a thriving rural village of 175 people, embracing inclusiveness, sustainability, enabling, localness and tradition as it’s values. In 2015, after huge amounts of work by the community, Fradswell was awarded a Big Lottery grant of £450,000 to demolish the old 1924 wooden village hall, and rebuild a new, fit-for-purpose community hub. This new hall was opened by the children of the village in 2016. Fradswell now has a wonderful hall, and a community Serenity Garden all set within the newly sited Village Green. A wonderful place to meet and socialise. Fradswell hosts 2 very popular annual events. In September, Frapfest! the Fradswell Apple festival - where locals exchange their apples for Fradswell cider and the donated apples are chopped and pressed to produce fresh apple juice, most of which is turned into Fradswell Cider over the Autumn. It’s a great community day with folk of all ages joining in.In January, it’s the Fradswell Wassail! A spectacular evening event with flaming torches, banging of instruments and music at which the community ‘wake the apple trees’ in expectation of a good summer crop. A lovely family event. Fradswell Community Hub also run regular monthly Coffee Mornings, Pop Up Bar and a highly successful monthly Lunch Club as well as other community events throughout the year.

François Rochebrune (Polish: Franciszek Rochebrune) (born 1 June or 1 January 1830, died 19 November 1870 (some sources state 1871)) was a French soldier. He was born to an impoverished family. He served in the French Zouaves during the Crimean War. He then lived in Poland for two years as a tutor. He returned to the French Zouaves for five years, serving as a sergeant in China. He then returned to live in Poland once again in 1862. When the Polish rebellion against Russian rule began in January 1863, he formed and led a Polish rebel unit called the Zouaves of Death. Within months, he had been promoted to general. After the collapse of the uprising, he returned to France, where his exploits in Poland earned him the rank of captain in the French army. He was promoted to colonel for the Franco-Prussian War, and was killed by a sniper at the Battle of Montretout at the age of forty.

German wine is primarily produced in the west of Germany, along the river Rhine and its tributaries, with the oldest plantations going back to the Roman era. Approximately 60 percent of German wine is produced in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, where 6 of the 13 regions (Anbaugebiete) for quality wine are situated. Germany has about 103,000 hectares (252,000 acres or 1,030 square kilometers) of vineyard, which is around one tenth of the vineyard surface in Spain, France or Italy. The total wine production is usually around 10 million hectoliters annually, corresponding to 1.3 billion bottles, which places Germany as the eighth-largest wine-producing country in the world. White wine accounts for almost two thirds of the total production. As a wine country, Germany has a mixed reputation internationally, with some consumers on the export markets associating Germany with the world's most elegant and aromatically pure white wines while other see the country mainly as the source of cheap, mass-market semi-sweet wines such as Liebfraumilch. Among enthusiasts, Germany's reputation is primarily based on wines made from the Riesling grape variety, which at its best is used for aromatic, fruity and elegant white wines that range from very crisp and dry to well-balanced, sweet and of enormous aromatic concentration. While primarily a white wine country, red wine production surged in the 1990s and early 2000s, primarily fuelled by domestic demand, and the proportion of the German vineyards devoted to the cultivation of dark-skinned grape varieties has now stabilized at slightly more than a third of the total surface. For the red wines, Spätburgunder, the domestic name for Pinot noir, is in the lead.

The history of Theravāda Buddhism begins in ancient India, where it was one of the early Buddhist schools which arose after the first schism of the Buddhist monastic community. After establishing itself in the Sri Lankan Anuradhapura Kingdom, Theravāda spread throughout mainland Southeast Asia (mainly in the region roughly corresponding to modern Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Laos) through the efforts of missionary monks and Southeast Asian kings. In the modern era, Theravāda Buddhism faced numerous challenges, such as Western colonialism and the arrival of Christian missionaries. In response, various Theravāda Buddhist Modernist movements arose, such as the Sri Lankan modernism of Anagarika Dharmapala, the Burmese vipassana movement and the Dhammayutika Nikaya, a new Thai monastic order. Furthermore, the modern era saw Theravāda became an international religion, with centers in the Western world. It also saw the development of Theravāda movements in Asian countries that were not traditionally home to the religion, like Nepal and Vietnam.

The officers were killed during a traffic stop where Tafero, his wife Sunny Jacobs and their children were passengers. Tafero's execution was botched; his head burst into flames during the execution by electric chair. After Tafero's execution, the driver, Walter Rhodes, confessed to shooting the officers.

John William Buxton Knight RBA (1843 – 2 January 1908), English landscape painter, was born in Sevenoaks, Kent. He started as a schoolmaster, but painting was his hobby, and he subsequently devoted himself to it. In 1861 he had his first picture hung at the Royal Academy. He was essentially an open-air painter, constantly going on sketching tours in the most picturesque spots of England, and all his pictures were painted out of doors. He died at Dover on 2 January 1908. The Chantrey trustees bought Knight's \"December's Bareness Everywhere\" for the nation in February 1908. Most of his best pictures had passed into the collection of Mr Iceton of Putney (including \"White Walls of Old England\" and \"Hereford Cathedral\"), Mr Walter Briggs of Burley in Wharfedale (especially \"Pinner\"), and Mr SM Phillips of Wrotham (especially two watercolours of Richmond Bridge). John William Buxton Knight was an English landscape painter who was true to nature and never weakened his conviction to become fashionable. \"To speak of him as the successor of Constable would not be without justification, not because he consciously or purposefully based himself upon that master, but because he had much of his predecessor’s spirit and unconventionality of method, and, as well, a full share of his artistic intelligence.\" Born in Sevenoaks, Kent to William Knight (1810 – 1878; accomplished artist and teacher of art), ‘Buxton Knight’ began his art studies at an early age, although not in any formal and systematic manner, but by working in the open air and observing nature. Knole Park in Sevenoaks was popular with many notable artists, who Buxton Knight made acquaintance with, helping inform his future path that included: \"a high position amongst the great exponents of English landscape…. which Constable and Crome would have been the first to recognise.\" At the age of 22 Buxton Knight went as a student into the Academy schools on the advice of Sir Edwin Henry Landseer, and was there for just two years. Prior to these formal studies he was already an exhibiting painter, having contributed his first canvas to the Academy at the age of 18 in 1861. He continued to exhibit at the Academy throughout his career and until the end of his life, with a total of 72 paintings. His last exhibition was in 1907 and subsequent to his death the following year, one of his two paintings exhibited in 1907, Old December Bareness Everywhere, was acquired by the Chantrey Bequest and bequeathed to the Tate for the benefit of the Nation. Despite exhibiting such a large number of paintings at the Royal Academy throughout his lifetime, Buxton Knight was never admitted as an Associate or an Academician, despite having been put forward numerous times. A year after his death, E Barrington Nash wrote: \"I am informed that Mr Knight’s name has lately been placed upon the list of candidates for the Royal Academy Associateship, but surely, with such great masterly works as ‘Dover’, ‘White Walls’, ‘Littlehampton’, ‘Hop-picking’, ‘Poole’, ‘Richmond Park’, (White Lodge), and many others en evidence before us, it is a matter of national disgrace that he has not been admitted a full-fledged R.A. long ago.\" \"There are few types of landscape that he has not painted: coast subjects, river scenery, mountains, moorland, and quiet stretches of pastoral meadow-land; all have been recorded by him at some time or other. As he wishes to associate only with her [Nature], he has to be ever out and about. And for the greater part of the year he lived in the open, painting industriously through spring, summer, and autumn, returning only when the winter winds make the nomad existence impossible even to the greatest art enthusiast…. Few modern landscape painters can affirm the same absolute self-sacrifice, or can plead that they have to such an extent subordinated the not unnatural inclination to assert individuality at the expense of fidelity to nature. That he should have done so all his life speaks well for his consistency, and implies a rare quality of belief in the soundest principals of art.\" \"While we have painters like John Buxton Knight to keep alive the best traditions of the English landscape school, there is certainly no fear that we shall lose our pre-eminent position among the nations which have produced the greater masters in this form of pictorial practice…. It is because Mr Buxton Knight has attacked and mastered the intricacies of British landscape and has made himself a typical exponent of all that is most characteristic in our insular atmosphere that it is possible to claim for him a place among the chief living leaders of our native art. For he represents more adequately than most of our present-day landscape painters what may be called legitimate school. He follows closely the old-established tradition, the sound and logical tradition, adopted by such masters as Constable, De Wint, and David Cox, which imposes upon all students of nature the obligation to observe shrewdly and to set down what they have observed with unhesitating individuality. He does not imitate his predecessors or formulate his practice in any unwise effort to reproduce their personal mannerisms and tricks of style; but he seeks, as they did, to see absolutely with his own eyes and by the frankest use of his own personality to give vitality and authority to his productions.\" \"Mr Knight in his nomadic existence is a living protest against convention. The ordinary confinement of a studio would become impossible to a man so devotedly attached to his mistress – Nature. Whatever he does is on the spot and there only. He lives and paints in the open nine months out of the twelve, in all weathers, sunshine or storm, seeing and studying Nature in every visible mood.\" Within Sir Alfred Munnings’ autobiography there is a story of a bet that he had with the Director of Leeds City Art Gallery (which has 31 Buxton Knight paintings), whether Buxton Knight had painted ‘Ingleborough Hall, Yorkshire’ in the open air, which the Director did not think could be done. It transpired with Munnings tracking down a retired postman in the neighbouring village of Clapham, Yorkshire, who confirmed that he passed Buxton Knight daily, sat off the footpath working on the big painting. One day the postman took Buxton Knight a letter, which he opened there, saying it brought him bad news as the Royal Academy had not elected him as Associate. Munnings comments that it was \"a story of the dashed hopes of one of our finest landscape-painters; a story reflecting little credit upon members of the Academy.\" Within Ann Galbally's book \"A Remarkable Friendship – Vincent Van Gogh and John Peter Russell\", there is mention that \"…Buxton Knight another friend of Russell and [Tom] Roberts, and known to Edward Combes, became something of a mentor to Roberts, Russell and other visiting Australian students, including E Phillips Fox. An interpreter of the cool, tonal landscape, tranquil and slightly melancholy at times, with a preference for autumnal scenes and twilight tones.... he became a foundation member of the New English Art Club in 1888. Combes nominated him for membership of the Art Society of New South Wales, where he exhibited in 1882 and 1883, years that Combes was president. One of his March 1883 exhibits, ‘Halcyon Days by Murmuring Stream’ was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales, along with another, ‘Deserted’, when Combes was President of Trustees. Knight returned the compliment by painting and exhibiting at the Royal Academy ‘La Peruse, Botany Bay. After Edward Combes’. Knight kept in touch with Russell during his Paris years and with Roberts when he returned to Melbourne, even becoming the subject of a request for an introduction from Roberts by the young Charles Conder in 1890.\" An obituary in the Examiner on 15 February 1908 remarked of Buxton Knight’s passing as follows: \"Death of a great artist. One of the greatest modern British landscape painters passed away recently, though his death and the loss caused by it to the art of his country have remained practically unnoticed. There are many connoisseurs who hold the late Mr Buxton Knight to be the equal, if not the superior, of the very leaders of modern landscape painting in Great Britain, though his work, like that of Arthur Melville or J Charles, was not very well known to the large public while the artist himself was still among the living. Mr Buxton Knight, who first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1861, excelled chiefly in his strong virile oil paintings of the English countryside, which were always remarkable for their firmness of handling and the sense of structure, of the solidity, of all objects.\" Within a review of an \"Art Exhibition of English Paintings\" on 2 January 1928, the quality of Buxton Knight was pronounced when describing an exhibited painting of his: \"The character of ‘Near Chertsey’, by the late J Buxton Knight, is best described by saying that we should like to see it hung between a Constable and a Sisley – with a Monet to complete the sequence – as marking a definite stage in the logical development of Impressionism.\"

Sir John Welleseley Gunston, 3rd Baronet (born July 1962) is the third Baronet of Wickwar in the County of Gloucestershire in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. He is perhaps better known for his exploits as a photographer in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Born in Nyasaland (later Malawi), he was the son of the local British commissioner in the town of Blantyre. Having lived in Cape Town, Johannesburg and London, Gunston enrolled at Harrow when he was 13. leaving after three years, Gunston returned to Africa to join the Police Anti-Terrorism Unit of the British South African Police in Rhodesia. He served for 18 months on the Mozambique-Zambian border seeing active service against both ZIPRA & ZANLA fighters attacking farms in the Sipolilo-Umvukwes area, before returning to England to enroll at the Royal Military Academy in Sandhurst, Surrey. From there he commissioned into the Irish Guards. After leaving the Guards, and having recovered from a serious car accident, in 1983, at the age of 21, Gunston decided to become a war photojournalist. Gunston made several trips into war-torn Afghanistan through the 1980s, covering the war between the occupying Soviet forces aligned to the Communist Afghan government, and mujahidin resistance groups. Overall making more than 25 trips with the mujahidin spending in excess of two years inside Afghanistan. Gunston was one of the relatively few western journalists who went inside Afghanistan during this period. He traveled at different times with the mujahidin groups controlled by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Ahmad Shah Massoud – he had the [mis] fortune of being captured in an ambush [1984] by Massoud's forces during which time he was wounded & taken prisoner, as result he was the only journalist to be with Massoud during the Soviet Panjshir VII operation [May–June 1984]. However it was with Haji Abdul Haq with whom Gunston formed a close friendship and it was with Haq's mujahidin in and around Kabul that he spent most of his time. Including a clandestine mission into Kabul [1988] to meet Afghan Army Generals who wanted to work with Haq following the Soviet withdrawal. Little has been written about Gunston's life before the Afghan war. Some relatively brief accounts of his exploits during the war can be found in Robert D. Kaplan's 1990 book, 'Soldiers of God – With the Mujahidin in Afghanistan.' Kaplan was a friend of Gunston, and also a journalist in Afghanistan during the 1980s. Also Rob Schultheis's 1992 book, 'Night Letters – Inside Wartime Afghanistan.' More recently, David Loyn's 2006 'Frontline: The True Story of the British Mavericks Who Changed the Face of War Reporting.' John Simpson also mentions meeting Gunston in Afghanistan in two of his memoirs. In the 1990s Gunston set up a documentary production company with , the widow of his good friend Rory Peck with whom he traveled inside Afghanistan during the 1980s. In 1995 Gunston was also co-founder with Juliet Peck of the Rory Peck Award & Trust. Following the 9/11 attacks, Gunston was asked to join Abdul Haq in Rome who was then meeting with the late Afghan King Mohammed Zahir Shah. As a result, Gunston led a small advisory team to Peshawar Afghanistan to assist Abdul Haq, as he put together a force of former mujahidin to cross back into Afghanistan and fight the Taliban. Gunston was also liaising on Haq's behalf with both British & US governments, as Taliban military leaders were keen to work with Abdul Haq in overthrowing the Taliban political leadership and their Al-Qaeda allies. At the time of Haq's death Gunston was in Rome lobbying the king on Haq's behalf. Following Abdul Haq's death Gunston was asked to join Haji Abdul Qadir at the Bonn peace conference where he was appointed a personal adviser to Qadir and the interim Eastern Shura. In late November Haji Qadir asked Gunston if he could assist his son, Haji Zahir Qadir, who was leading Qadir's former mujahidin in a sector at the battle of Tora Bora. Gunston took a small team of advisers to Jalalabad to help Haji Zahir. His advisory appointment continued up until Vice President Qadir's assassination in July 2002. Since then, Gunston has continued to work closely with various Afghan leaders, NGOs, and companies involved in Afghanistan.

This is a list of notable individuals who were buried at the Congressional Cemetery in Washington, D.C., as well as those who are memorialized by cenotaphs. In particular, many U.S. senators and U.S representatives are memorialized by cenotaphs at the cemetery. Specialized terminology is used on this list. The term cenotaph includes not only monuments that are \"empty tombs\" or where the body is buried elsewhere, but also the graves of Congressmen who died in office which are marked by the particular style of cenotaph designed by Benjamin Latrobe for the Cemetery. \"Congressman\" refers to any U.S. senator or representative. A range/site listing, e.g. R31/S44, after a name gives the location of the grave or cenotaph according to the cemetery's location system.(This is a dynamic list and may never be able to satisfy particular standards for completeness.

Louis Francisque Lélut (1804–1877) was a French medical doctor and philosopher known for his works Démon de Socrate and L'Amulette de Pascal, where he stated that Socrates and Blaise Pascal were insane. Born at Gy, a small village in the Haute-Saône department, he was member of the Academy of Moral and Political Sciences and researched mental illnesses and phrenology. His main work was Physiologie de la pensée, published in 1861. During the Second French Empire he was member of the Legislative Body.

Lucella MacLean [Ross] (January 3, 1921 – June 25, 2012) was a former utility who played from 1943 through 1944 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. She batted and threw right handed. A native of Lloydminster, MacLean was one of the fifty seven girls from Canada who played in the AAGPBL during its 12-year history. She also was one of the sixty original players in the inaugural season of the league. MacLean was the fourth of nine children born to Anna and John Angus MacLean. She graduated from Lloydminster High School in 1940. Interested in sports and athletically inclined from a young age, she began skating at the age of four and was soon involved in field hockey and softball. Throughout school she won awards for her sporting excellence at basketball and track and field. Softball belonged to the town and city leagues, where MacLean played from 1935 to 1942. She started to play with the Lloydminster nationals' senior team, who won the Ester Trophy in Saskatoon from 1937 to 1940. In that year, she joined the Saskatoon Pats and helped her team to the Provincial Hunking Trophy in 1941. When MacLean was not playing she worked as a telephone clerk until 1943. The AAGPBL was introduced in the spring of 1943, featuring young women with both athletic ability and feminine appeal. Hundreds of girls were eager to play in the new league, and 280 were invited to final tryouts at Wrigley Field in Chicago, Illinois. Of those, sixty were selected as the first women to play on the first four teams: the Kenosha Comets, Racine Belles, Rockford Peaches and South Bend Blue Sox. MacLean was located to the Blue Sox, playing for them two season as a backup for catcher Bonnie Baker. She also saw action at first base and right field, appearing in 101 games while hitting a .204 average with 25 runs batted in. In addition, she started the first triple play in AAGPBL history. In 1945 MacLean returned to Canada to catch for the Army and Navy Pats of Edmonton. She later spent seven years in the National Girls Baseball League, playing from 1946 to 1953 for the Admiral Music Maids, Chicago Chicks, Chicago Bluebirds, Parichy Bloomer Girls and Rockola Chicks. MacLean stayed working in the United States until 1959 and then returned to Canada. She became married in 1951 to Jesse Moore. Widowed in 1957, she married to George Ross in 1960. In recognition of her athletic contribution, she was inducted into the Saskatchewan Baseball Hall of Fame and is also in the Alberta Hall of Fame and the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame. She also is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York. The exhibition was unveiled on November 5, 1988, to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities. In 2012, in partnership with the Ross family, Girls Prairie League Softball began awarding the MacLean-Ross Cup in MacLean's memory.

Mark 8 is the eighth chapter of the Gospel of Mark in the New Testament of the Christian Bible. It contains two miracles of Jesus, Peter's confession that he believes Jesus is the Messiah, and Jesus' first prediction of his own death and resurrection. It is the middle chapter of the gospel but its significance is variously understood: for example the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary calls it a \"section of miscellaneous matter\" whereas many commentators treat it as a turning point where Mark's description of Jesus as teacher and miracle worker gives way to his focus on the role of Jesus' death and the difficult nature of his teachings.

Maryland Route 273 (MD 273) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland. Known for most of its length as Telegraph Road, the highway runs 16.58 miles (26.68 km) from U.S. Route 1 (US 1) near Harrisville east to the Delaware state line near Appleton, where the highway continues east as Delaware Route 273 (DE 273). MD 273 is the main east–west highway of northern Cecil County, connecting Conowingo (via US 1), Port Deposit (via MD 276), and Rising Sun with Newark, Delaware, via the communities of Calvert and Fair Hill, where the highway intersects MD 272 and MD 213, respectively. The state highway also provides access to the Fair Hill Training Center and the Fair Hill Natural Resources Management Area. MD 273 west of Fair Hill was constructed as one of the original state roads starting in the early 1910s. MD 273 west of and through Rising Sun was the original course of US 1, which was paved from the Susquehanna River to northeast of Rising Sun in the 1910s. The state highway east of Rising Sun was paved in several sections between the mid-1910s and the late 1920s. The portion of original US 1 west of Octoraro Creek comprised a western segment of MD 273 from the late 1920s to the late 1950s. The section of US 1 that followed present-day MD 273 was reconstructed in the early to mid-1950s, shortly before MD 273 was extended west to its present western terminus when US 1 was placed on the Rising Sun Bypass in the late 1950s. The highway was reconstructed from east of Rising Sun to the Delaware state line in several stages from the late 1950s to the early 1970s.

Mochras (commonly known as Shell Island), is a peninsula lying west of Llanbedr in Gwynedd, Wales. It was formed after the River Artro was diverted by the Earl of Winchelsey in 1819 from its previous course where it entered the sea to the south of Mochras. Prior to this, access to the ancient settlement on the 'island' would have been through the village of Llandanwg, which is now across the estuary. Mochras is known for the wide variety of seashells that wash up on the beach, and for its wild flowers. It is said to have been connected to the mythical Cantre'r Gwaelod. Public vehicular access to the peninsula is only possible via a causeway across the estuary of the River Artro when the tide is out. Access on foot is always possible from the adjacent Morfa Dyffryn beach, which extends for several kilometres south of Mochras. Access to emergency vehicles is available at any time through the neighbouring airfield. Mochras has a popular camp site which offers the opportunity to practise \"wild camping\" in pitches which are far from the nearest neighbour (and from toilet and other facilities). Camp fires are allowed on the beach; on the campsite only raised contained fires and barbecues are allowed. The peninsula lies within the Snowdonia National Park, as a result of which the campsite closes from the end of October to the following March. During this period local farmers bring their sheep from the lowlands to graze on the 'island'.

Monardella sheltonii is a species of flowering plant in the mint family known by the common name Shelton's monardella.

The Monastery of the Angels is the cloistered convent of a Roman Catholic religious order for women in Karachi, Pakistan. The community is made up of nine Dominican sisters. They dedicate their lives to constant prayer with one of them always present in the chapel. They receive many letters, telephone calls, faxes and e-mail with prayer requests. The mother superior of the monastery and her assistant read the newspapers to learn about the situation in the world. They then tell the other sisters about the important things happening outside the cloisters. The sisters are separated from the outside world by a grate. This divides them from the guests who visit them, from the priest who celebrates Mass for them, and even from the relatives who come to visit them on certain days. Daily life in the convent is similar to that in other cloisters throughout the world. The sisters typically make bread, cakes, sweets, hosts and wine for the parishes. These products are placed near a small opening where people come to pick them up. When Archbishop Joseph Cordeiro became archbishop of Karachi in 1958, he invited a community of contemplative nuns to the diocese. In December 1959, nine nuns from the monastery in Los Angeles arrived in Pakistan to found the monastery in Karachi. On July 20, 1968, the convent was moved from Ingle Road to its current location in the Landhi area of Karachi. Fr. James deSouza was the first Chaplain of the Monastery. Later when he became the Rector of the St. Pius X Minor Seminary he used to send his young Seminarians to help the sisters whenever they had some difficult work like cleaning of the Retreat House, a special planting project in the garden, or other heavy jobs. The sisters in turn supplied them with home – made jam, bakery goods, and fruits and vegetables from their garden. On December 20, 2009 the Monastery celebrated the 50th anniversary of its beginning in Pakistan. However, there had been no one joining their number in ten years. Archbishop Evarist Pinto of Karachi, celebrated a special Mass at the monastery chapel, concelebrated with Bishop Max John Rodrigues of Hyderabad, Karachi Vicar General Father Arthur Charles, and 17 other priests. In 2013 all the sisters were Pakistani. In 2016, there were ten professed nuns and two second year novices in the community.

The murder of Hadiya Pendleton occurred on January 29, 2013. Pendleton, a 15-year-old Black girl from Chicago, Illinois, was shot in the back and killed while standing with friends inside Harsh Park in Kenwood, Chicago after taking her final exams. As a student at King College Prep High School, she was killed only one week after performing at events for President Barack Obama’s second inauguration. First Lady Michelle Obama attended the funeral for Pendleton in Chicago. President Obama mentioned Pendleton's death in his 2013 State of the Union Address in Congress, where Pendleton's parents, Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton and Nathaniel A. Pendleton Sr., attended as guests. The crime scene is \"just a mile away from [President Obama's] Chicago house\". Pendleton's mother, Cleopatra Cowley-Pendleton, went onstage but did not speak at the 2016 Democratic National Convention.

Necking, in engineering or materials science, is a mode of tensile deformation where relatively large amounts of strain localize disproportionately in a small region of the material. The resulting prominent decrease in local cross-sectional area provides the basis for the name \"neck\". Because the local strains in the neck are large, necking is often closely associated with yielding, a form of plastic deformation associated with ductile materials, often metals or polymers. Once necking has begun, the neck becomes the exclusive location of yielding in the material, as the reduced area gives the neck the largest local stress.

Nehemiah Abbott (March 29, 1804 – July 26, 1877) was a United States Representative from Maine. He was born in Sidney, studied law at the Litchfield, Connecticut Law School, was admitted to the bar in 1836 and began his practice at Calais, Maine. In 1839 Abbott moved to Columbus, Mississippi, where he continued the practice of law, but the following year he returned to Maine and settled in Belfast, Waldo County, where he resumed the practice of law. In 1842 and 1843 he was a member of the Maine House of Representatives. He was elected as a Republican to the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from March 4, 1857, to March 3, 1859. He did not run for reelection, but continued to practice law, and served as the mayor of Belfast in 1865 and 1866. He died in Belfast.

Neptuak Mountain was named by Samuel E.S. Allen in 1894. \"Neptuak\" is the Stoney Indian word for \"nine\" as Neptuak Mountain is peak #9 in the Valley of the Ten Peaks. It is located on the Continental Divide, which is also the British Columbia-Alberta border in this region, and is in the Bow Range of the Park Ranges of the Canadian Rockies. The summit is a tripoint for Banff National Park, Kootenay National Park, and Yoho National Park, where the three parks share a common border.

Route 103 is a highway in New Brunswick, Canada, running from Woodstock to Florenceville along the west bank of the Saint John River, a distance of 42 kilometres. Route 103 begins at the interchange between the Trans-Canada Highway and Route 555 and passes the eastern terminus of Route 95, where it connects the interchange to downtown Woodstock and Interstate 95 via the Houlton Road. The route turns north along Main Street, following the Saint John River bank. At Somerville, a feeder road off Route 103 leads to the longest covered bridge in the world, connecting to the town of Hartland. The route ends at an intersection with Route 110 in Florenceville. Until 2003, Route 103 began south of Woodstock at a former Trans-Canada intersection at , but with a new twinned section of the highway opening and a small part of Route 2 being abandoned, Route 103 was shortened to end in Woodstock. A new highway, Route 165, now uses the former Trans-Canada from Meductic to Bulls Creek and the former Route 103 routing to downtown Woodstock.

Newbern is an unincorporated community in Pulaski County, in the U.S. state of Virginia. From 1839 until the court house burned in 1892, Newbern was the county seat of Pulaski County A large share of the early settlers being natives of Switzerland caused the name Newbern, after Bern, Switzerland, to be selected. The Newbern Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Adam Hance began the town of Newbern in 1810, where the Wilderness Road or \"Great road\" passed directly through his grant of 1,400 acres. This holding was approximately halfway between Christiansburg, Virginia and Wytheville, Virginia. His home is located in the Newbern Historic District.

The oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), also known as the water-splitting complex, is the portion of photosystem II where photo-oxidation of water occurs during the light reactions of photosynthesis. The OEC is surrounded by four core protein subunits of photosystem II at the membrane-lumen interface. In the overall water oxidation reaction, four electrons are extracted from two water molecules so that four protons and one O2 molecule are produced. The molecular machinery for oxidizing water requires the ability to store the oxidizing potential resulting from three light-induced charge separations before the fourth provides sufficient oxidizing power for water oxidation.

It can reach a maximum length of 6.2 centimetres (2.4 in) SL.

The Poteau School Gymnasium-Auditorium, located at Walter and Parker Sts. in Poteau in Le Flore County, Oklahoma, was built in 1937. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It was a project of the Works Progress Administration. It is a two-story 100 by 78 feet (30 m × 24 m) building built of coursed cream-colored native sandstone, with a roof that is flat and gabled and has parapets. Its NRHP nomination describes its importance: The gym/auditorium is significant because is provided space for school and community activities, especially basketball, which fostered a sense of identity and pride lacking in the depression era. Construction of it also provided work opportunities for unskilled and unemployed laborers in the Poteau area where few had existed previously. As a WPA building, the structure is notable for its size/scale. Within the community it is unique architecturally because of its type, style, scale, materials and workmanship. It was one of 48 buildings and 11 structures reviewed in a 1985 study of WPA works in southeastern Oklahoma, which led to almost all of them being listed on the National Register in 1988.

The Rainbow Coalition was an antiracist, anticlass multicultural movement founded April 4, 1969 in Chicago, Illinois by Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party, along with William \"Preacherman\" Fesperman of the Young Patriots Organization and José Cha Cha Jiménez, founder of the Young Lords. It was the first of several 20th century black-led organizations to use the \"rainbow coalition\" concept. Some members of the Young Patriots included Jack (Junebug) Boykin, Bobby Joe Mcginnis and Hy Thurman who worked with Field Marshall Bobby Lee of the Black Panthers. The founder of the coalition, Fred Hampton, first met Jose Cha Cha Jimenez of the Young Lords in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood the day after the Young Lords were in the news, after they had occupied the police community workshop meeting of the 18th District Police Station. Fred Hampton was arrested twice in February 1969 with Jose Cha Cha Jimenez at the Wicker Park Welfare Office. Both were charged with Mob Action during peaceful pickets of the welfare office protesting mistreatment of the patrons. The Rainbow Coalition soon included various radical socialist community groups like the Lincoln Park Poor People's Coalition, later, the coalition was joined nationwide by the Students for a Democratic Society (\"SDS\"), the Brown Berets, the American Indian Movement and the Red Guard Party. In April 1969, Hampton called several press conferences to announce that this \"Rainbow Coalition\" had formed. Some of the things the coalition engaged in joint action against was poverty, corruption, racism, police brutality, and substandard housing. The participating groups supported each other at protests, strikes, and demonstrations where they had a common cause. Author Jeffrey Haas has praised some of Hampton's politics, and his work unifying movements are things we can learn from him. However, Haas was critical towards the way Hampton and the BPP had organized in a pyramid/vertical like structure. Hass has praised the horizontal structure of Black Lives Matter stating: \"They may also have picked up on the vulnerability of a hierarchal movement where you have one leader, which makes the movement very vulnerable if that leader is imprisoned, killed, or otherwise compromised. I think the fact that Black Lives Matter says, \"We're leaderfull, not leaderless\" perhaps makes them less vulnerable to this kind of government assault.\" The coalition later included many other local groups like Rising Up Angry, and Mothers and Others. The Coalition also brokered treaties to end crime and gang violence. Hampton, Jimenez and their colleagues believed that the Richard J. Daley Democratic Party machine in Chicago used gang wars to consolidate their own political positions by gaining funding for law enforcement and dramatizing crime rather than underlying social issues. The phrase \"rainbow coalition\" was co-opted over the years by Reverend Jesse Jackson, who eventually appropriated the name in forming his own, more moderate coalition, Rainbow/PUSH. Some scholars, including Peniel Joseph, assert that the original rainbow coalition concept was a prerequisite for the multicultural coalition that Barack Obama built his political career upon.

The original Regensburg Synagogue, erected between 1210 and 1227, was an edifice in Old Romanesque style in Regensburg, southern Germany, on the site of the former Jewish hospital, in the center of the ghetto, where the present Neue Pfarre stands. Two etchings made by Albrecht Altdorfer of the synagogue shortly before it was destroyed on February 22, 1519, provide the first portrait of an actual architectural monument in European printmaking. In 1519 following the death of Emperor Maximilian, who had long been a protector of the Jews in the imperial cities, extracting from them substantial taxes in exchange, the city of Regensburg, which blamed its economic troubles on its prosperous Jewish community, expelled the 500 Jews. The Jews themselves had demolished the interior of their venerable synagogue, on the site of which a chapel was built in honor of the Virgin. According to a chronicle the exiles settled, under the protection of the Duke of Bavaria, on the opposite bank of the Danube, in Stadt-am-Hof, and in villages in the vicinity; from these they were expelled in the course of the same century. In 1669 Jews were again permitted to reside in Regensburg but it was not until April 2, 1841, that the community was able to dedicate its new synagogue. In 1907 however, it was demolished for fear of collapse. Rebuilt in 1912 at a different place, when the town had a Jewish population of about 600, it was destroyed by the Nazis on November 9, 1938, during Kristallnacht.

In geometry, a right conoid is a ruled surface generated by a family of straight lines that all intersect perpendicularly to a fixed straight line, called the axis of the right conoid. Using a Cartesian coordinate system in three-dimensional space, if we take the z-axis to be the axis of a right conoid, then the right conoid can be represented by the parametric equations: where h(u) is some function for representing the height of the moving line.

The River Medina is the main river of the Isle of Wight, England, rising at St Catherine's Down near Chale, and flowing northwards through the county town Newport, towards the Solent at Cowes. The river is a navigable tidal estuary from Newport northwards, where it takes the form of a ria (a drowned valley). This occurred because the Medina used to be a tributary of what was once the \"River Solent\", with a larger catchment area. As the Solent valley flooded, the river received less water and more sediment, causing it to become more tidal. The river is bridged at Newport. Cowes is connected to East Cowes by a chain ferry known as the Cowes Floating Bridge. The river also has several small ferries which cater mainly for sailors. The name Medina comes from the Old English Meðune meaning \"the middle one\", and the current pronunciation was first recorded as 'Medine' in 1196. The river's only named tributary is . The navigation of the river was improved in the nineteenth century by , a civil engineer who lived in Newport. The river is used by yachtsmen as a safe harbour. Along its banks there are old warehouses and wharves, where in the past flying boats, hovercraft and steam ships were developed and built.

State Temple of the Martial God, also called Tainan Sacrificial Rites Martial Temple (Chinese: 祀典武廟; pinyin: Sìdiǎn Wǔmiào) or Grand Guandi Temple, is a temple located in Yongfu Rd., West Central District, Tainan, Taiwan. This temple was previously the palace of Koxinga and Prince of Ningjing, members of the Ming royal family who retreated to Taiwan in the dying days of the Ming dynasty. This temple is dedicated to the deity Guan Gong, who is the most widely worshipped deity in Taiwan and Mainland China. The statue of Guan-Gong in this temple was brought to Taiwan from Fujian Province, China by relatives of Prince of Ningjing during the Ming dynasty. There are also two smaller temples on the site. The temple of Guanyin, a Buddhist fertility goddess whose image can be found in nearly every Taoist temple, and the temple of Yue Lao, where single people pray for luck to find their soul mate. There is also a horse-god temple located across the Yong-Fu Rd. The horse-god takes the form of a soldier who looks after the horses. Because Guan-Gong was always assisted in his work by horses, his followers build this temple to show their respect and appreciation.

Steve Petuskey is a retired American soccer player who played professionally in the American Professional Soccer League and Continental Indoor Soccer League. He is widely considered to be the finest soccer player of his era from the Sacramento area. Petuskey played most of his prime in the Central California Soccer League (CCSL), first with Celtic F.C., coached by Fr. Michael Carroll, and then with Turn Verein, winning numerous league titles and one State Cup with the latter. Unfortunately, despite the presence of a few perennially strong teams, the CCSL was considered a level below its San Francisco and Los Angeles counterparts and Petuskey was ignored in the U.S. Men's National Team selection process in the lead up to the 1990 World Cup in Italy. In 1979, Petusky graduated from Cordova High School. He attended and played for Cosumnes River College from 1979–81, where he led the team to league titles in both years. He attended Sacramento State University, playing on the men’s soccer team in 1981 and 1982. He was a 1982 NCAA Division II First Team All American. On December 11, 1996, Sacramento State inducted Petusky into its Hall of Fame. In 1989, Petuskey played for the Sacramento Senators of the Western Soccer League. In 1990, he moved to the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the American Professional Soccer League, which was formed by the merger of the Western Soccer League and American Soccer League. In 1993, Petuskey moved indoors with the Sacramento Knights of the Continental Indoor Soccer League. He played for the Knights in both 1993 and 1994. In 1994, he won the U.S. Open Cup with Greek-American A.C., scoring in the semi-finals.

Wayne E. Baker is an American author and sociologist on the senior faculty of the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. His teaching and research interests are in the fields of values, American society, social capital, social networks and economic sociology. Baker is best known both for his research in economic sociology, where he demonstrated that financial markets operate as social networks, and his survey research on values, where he documented Americans’ core values.

These core values include patriotism, belief in God, individualism, success, equal opportunities, freedom and liberty, respect and the free market. He writes in both academic and popular media on this theme and is often invited to present his findings across the U.S

The White Plains Armory is a historic building in White Plains, New York, in Westchester County. Located at 65 Mitchell Place/35 South Broadway, the building was built to serve as a National Guard armory. Construction of the building began in 1909 and was completed in 1910. The building was designed by architect James E. Ware. The building was 31,612 square feet and takes up three-quarters of an acre. 49th Separate Company/Company L, 10th Infantry Regiment occupied the armory from 1910 to 1939. From April 1924 to November 1929, the White Plains Armory was the temporary headquarters of Troop K of the New York State Police, after a March 3, 1924 fire destroyed the troop's headquarters at Gedney Farms. The police troop left the Armory in November 1929 after a new headquarters in Hawthorne was completed. Subsequently, the building's tenants were the 106th Infantry Regiment and then the Headquarters and Headquarters Battalion, Company D, 212th Field Artillery. It is located on the site of the first courthouse where the Declaration of Independence was read on July 11, 1776. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

A wiring pencil (often sold under the trade names of Roadrunner or Verowire) is a tool for making electrical connections. A small reel of insulated copper wire is mounted at the top of the tool. The wire runs down the center of the wiring pencil and through a hardened tip, which is small enough to move between the pins of 0.1\" pitch DIL chip allowing connections to be wrapped and the wire to be led across the circuit board to the next point it's needed. The wire is coated with a polymer lacquer (commonly referred to as enamel, but not glass based). Once wrapped the connections are soldered, the heat of this burning the lacquer away and completing the joint. Insulated wire is normally 38 SWG (0.15mm), ground connections are sometimes made with uninsulated wire which is slightly heavier (33 SWG, 0.25mm). A well ventilated area and/or fume extraction are very important when carrying out this process due to the toxic fumes. Sometimes, where there are many wires, plastic comb-like structures are used for wire management.

The men's freestyle light heavyweight competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London took place from 29 July to 31 July at the Empress Hall, Earls Court Exhibition Centre. Nations were limited to one competitor. This freestyle wrestling competition continued to use the \"bad points\" elimination system introduced at the 1928 Summer Olympics for Greco-Roman and at the 1932 Summer Olympics for freestyle wrestling, with the slight modification introduced in 1936. Each round featured all wrestlers pairing off and wrestling one bout (with one wrestler having a bye if there were an odd number). The loser received 3 points if the loss was by fall or unanimous decision and 2 points if the decision was 2-1 (this was the modification from prior years, where all losses were 3 points). The winner received 1 point if the win was by decision and 0 points if the win was by fall. At the end of each round, any wrestler with at least 5 points was eliminated.
