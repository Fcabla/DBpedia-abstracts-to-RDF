Highway 95 (Arabic: الطريق السريع ٩٥, romanized: at-Tariq as-Saree' 95), also known as the Abu Hadriyah Highway, is a major highway in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Beginning at the Batha' border crossing with the United Arab Emirates, the highway extends to the Kuwaiti border, passing near or through the cities of Khobar, Dammam, Qatif, Jubail and Khafji, spanning 646 km (401 mi). The highway also provides access to the King Fahd Causeway which connects Bahrain to Saudi Arabia. The highway consists of three traffic lanes and a shoulder, for a total of eight lanes, of which six carry traffic. All but one of the intersections of the highway are grade separated (the northernmost intersection with Route 611 is not grade-separated), and the two sides of the road are separated by a median strip. The route traverses the eastern coastal plain of Saudi Arabia, and is thus mostly straight for most of its route, running concurrently with Highway 85 north of Dammam. The concurrency with Highway 85 ends near the town of Abu Hadriyah. The highway runs parallel to the Persian Gulf coast of Saudi Arabia. It was initially built by a joint venture between Entreprise Jean Lefebvre, a French company, and several Saudi partners, who appealed to hundreds of expatriate men to do the job. Most of these expatriates had the only right to live a single life in camps in the desert during their stays in Saudi Arabia. The highway serves as the main land route for the transport of goods between the eastern Arab countries.

Atikaya was the son of Ravana and his second wife Dhanyamalini in the Ramayana epic. Atikaya was the younger brother of Meghanada and was extremely powerful. Once upon a time when he infuriated Lord Shiva atop Mount Kailasha, the God hurled his Trishula (divine trident) at Atikaya, but Atikaya caught the Trishula in mid air and folded his hands before the lord in a humble manner. Lord Shiva was pleased at seeing this, and benevolently blessed Atikaya with the secrets of archery and divine weapons. Due to his extraordinary skills and superiority, he had to be slain by Lakshmana by using a Brahmastra, the supremely powerful arrow obtained by the blessings of Lord Brahma. The secret was revealed to Lakshmana by the elemental God of Wind, Vayu at the behest of Lord Indra, that an otherwise invincible armour of Lord Brahma was granted to Atikaya, that could only be pierced by a Brahmastra. Atikaya and his uncle Kumbhakarana are believed to be incarnations of the demons Madhu and Kaitabha, who were tricked and killed by Vishnu at the creation of the world. Though this is not believed by all Hindus, since the most prominent belief is that Kumbhakarna was actually the incarnation of Vijaya, (other being Ravana, incarnation of Jaya, this is for second time and the first incarnated as Hiranyakashipu and Hiranyaksha both being slayed by incarnations of Vishnu, Varaha and Narasimha as per the curse) the guardian of Vishnu. As known he incarnated as Kumbhakarna because of the curse given to him by the rishis for not allowing them to meet Vishnu and also harassing the four kumaras in the seventh gateway to Vaikuntha.

The CMR Convention (full title Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road) is a United Nations convention that was signed in Geneva on 19 May 1956. It relates to various legal issues concerning transportation of cargo by road. It has been ratified by the majority of European states. As of January 2022, it has been ratified by 58 states. Based on the CMR, the International Road Transport Union (IRU) developed a standard CMR waybill. The CMR waybill is prepared in three languages. On the back is the text again in three languages. This aids the waybill in being accepted and recognised throughout Europe. Checked by customs and police, a transport document must be present when the shipment is transported. The document itself is not prescribed; there is a minimum of information required on the CMR. If hazardous substances are being shipped, some additional information is required, as described in ADR. This consignment is completed by the sender. The consignment should only be completed with a ballpoint pen, typewriter or computer. The driver who uses the consignment should be familiar with the consignment, and with the waybill, able to inform the recipient about the importance of the various topics on the waybill. As of the 27th of May 2008, according to an additional protocol to the CMR-convention, it is also possible to use an updated electronic consignment note – eCMR. As of February 2017, several solutions are available. ITD, Trade association for the Danish road transport of goods has developed a solution; the eCMR waybill. The eCMR is also available on the market in France, Spain and the Netherlands. First cross-border usage of eCMR took place on 19 January 2017, between Spain and France supported by ASTIC (Asociación de Transporte Internacional por Carretera) and FNTR (Fédération Nationale des Transports Routiers). On 24 February 2017, the UN reaffirmed its support to eCMR.

Caerphilly railway works in Caerphilly (Welsh: Caerffili) in the county of Glamorgan was the only main railway works in Wales. It was built for the Rhymney Railway in 1899 and taken over by the Great Western Railway at amalgamation in 1923. Much of its initial work was in refurbishing older locomotives with new boilers and covered cabs. In 1906, who had been at Gorton locomotive works became Locomotive Superintendent and appointed as Works Foreman. Their policy was to modernise and standardise the locomotive stock, and Riches designed a standard boiler and cylinders for all the railway's tank engines. He also designed a new class of 0-6-2 tank engine to be built by Robert Stephenson and Company who had provided six of their own design in 1903. In 1919 Sellars became the Works Manager. Until 1922 the works only repaired its own locomotives, but they began to be sent from the Barry Railway and in 1924 the first Swindon-built locomotive arrived. The works was enlarged with a new erecting shop in 1926. The works also maintained a variety of wagons and passenger vehicles, building new mineral wagons and a few carriages, with a new workshop in 1901. However a new wagon works was built at Cardiff and, with work finishing its main work of converting Westinghouse air brakes to GWR vacuum brakes, the carriage and wagon works was phased out. However, in 1939 new workshops were built for carriage repairs only. Until 1952 only tank engines had been repaired, but the efficiency of the works was such that they were asked to handle the smaller two-cylinder tender engines. They were so successful that larger engines were sent, the first being the 4-6-0 Number 5955 Garth Hall. Around 1958 Swindon was committed to diesel locomotives and Caerphilly was sent Castle class and BR Standard locomotives. With the withdrawal of steam on British Railways, the works closed in 1963 and the site converted into an industrial estate.

During World War II, the entertainment industry changed to help the war effort. Often the industry became more closely controlled by national governments, who believed that a supportive home front was crucial to victory. Through regulation and censorship, governments sought to keep spirits high and to depict the war in a positive light. They also found new ways to use entertainment media to keep citizens informed. Government censorship of mass media was enforced because of fears of threats to national harmony and security. The most popular forms of entertainment were radio, film, and music. Together these aimed to keep citizens entertained, informed about the war effort, and motivated. Broadcast radio was an especially powerful communication tool.

John Wilfred Jenkinson (1871–1915) was a pioneer in the field of comparative developmental biology (the forerunner of evolutionary developmental biology) and one of the first to introduce experimental embryology to the UK at the start of the 20th century. He originally studied Classics as an undergraduate student at Oxford, before switching his attention to Zoology under the guidance of W. F. R. Weldon at University College London. He also travelled to Utrecht in the Netherlands, to work with Hubrecht, and was exposed to new methods and approaches in embryology. In 1905, he was appointed the first lecturer in Embryology at the University of Oxford in England, and in 1909 published the first English textbook on experimental embryology in which he summarized recent work in the emerging scientific discipline and criticized neo-vitalist theories of Hans Driesch. At the outbreak of war in 1914, Jenkinson joined the Oxford Volunteer Training Corps. In January 1915 he was assigned to the 12th Battalion of the Worcestershire Regiment and was soon promoted to the rank of captain. Jenkinson left England with his regiment in May, posted to the Dardanelles in Turkey. On 4 June 1915, just days after arriving on the Gallipoli peninsula, Jenkinson was killed. After Jenkinson's death at Gallipoli in June 1915, the University of Oxford established the John Wilfred Jenkinson Lectureship in his memory. The original statutes required the lecturer or lecturers, appointed annually, to deliver “one or more lectures or lecture demonstrations on comparative or experimental embryology”. Each year, a Board of Electors selects one or two Jenkinson Lecturers who are invited to Oxford to present a lecture in the broad area of developmental biology.

Leighton Parks (10 February 1852-21 March 1938) was a liberal American Protestant Episcopal clergyman. He was born in New York City and graduated from the General Theological Seminary in 1876. Ordained a priest the next year, from 1878 to 1904 he was the third rector of Emmanuel Church, Boston. He then became rector of St. Bartholomew's Church, New York, succeeding David H. Greer, who had been elected Bishop of the diocese. He was \"a militant defender of theological modernism who denied the Virgin birth and defied the Bishops of his church to unfrock him for heresy\". Dr. Parks, who became noted for his direct and uncompromising preaching to one of the wealthiest congregations in the country, published The Winning of the Soul and Other Sermons (1893) and Moral Leadership and Other Sermons (1914). He first came to widespread attention when he \"made a spirited attack\" on the Roman Catholic Church, claiming it sought \"political domination and a war with Great Britain\". Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt Sr. ceased to worship at St. Bartholomew's following Parks's attacks on conservative elements within his own church. On the more-diplomatic side, in 1908, Parks convened a dinner meeting of New York church musicians, which continues to this day as St. Wilfrid Club, a longstanding organization of prominent organists. In 1878, Parks married Margaret Alden Haven, an expatriate then living in Geneva, Switzerland, and they became the parents of at least three daughters.

Lhachen Palgyigon (c. 930 – c. 960) (Tibetan: དཔལ་གྱི་མགོན, Wylie: dpal gyi mgon) was the founding king of the Kingdom of Maryul, based in modern Ladakh. Palgyigon was a son of Kyide Nyimagon, a descendant of the Old Tibetan dynasty, who unified the Western Tibet (Ngari) during the Tibetan Era of Fragmentation. Palgyigon was the eldest of three brothers, the other two being and . Palgyigon is said to have extended the kingdom of his father to the \"Kashmir pass\" (Zoji La) in the northwest, along what were referred to as the \"lowlands of Ngari\" (mar-yul of mṅah‐ris). He became an independent king after his father's death. The other two sons of Nyimagon, Trashigon and Detsukgon, also inherited the kingdoms of Guge‐Purang and Zanskar respectively. The three kingdoms together were referred to as \"Ngari Korsum\" (Wylie: mNga' ris skor gsum, \"the three divisions of Ngari\"). The kingdom of Maryul lasted till 1842 when the Dogra general Zorawar Singh, having conquered it, made it part of the princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault is major geological fault that runs a length of roughly 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) in a NNE-SSW orientation and exhibits current seismicity. It is located in the Chilean Northern Patagonian Andes. It is a dextral intra-arc strike-slip fault. Most large stratovolcanoes of the Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes are aligned by the fault which allows for the movement of magma and hydrothermal fluids. The fault crosses several transverse faults including the Mocha-Villarrica Fault Zone (MVFZ) and the Biobío-Aluminé Fault Zone. The fault have had periods of ductile deformation associated to pluton emplacement be it either at great depths or by shallow intrusions. The forces that move the fault are derivative of the oblique subduction offshore Chile's coast. This leads to partition of deformation between the subduction zone, the fore-arc and the intra-arc region where the fault lies. A portion of the fault in Aysén Region likely slipped (moved) in an aftershock a few weeks after the 1960 Valdivia earthquake. This same portion slipped again in April 2007 causing earthquakes in Aysén Fjord, triggering landslides and a local tsunami. The fault name was coined by Francisco Hervé, I. Fuenzalida, E. Araya and A. Solano in 1979. The fault itself was first inferred by Chilean government agent Hans Steffen around 1900 who referred to it as a \"tectonic furrow\" (Spanish: surco tectónico).

Basketball is a sport contested at the Summer Olympic Games. A men's basketball tournament was first held at the 1904 Olympics as a demonstration; it has been held at every Summer Olympics since 1936. In the 1972 Olympics, the final game between the United States and the Soviet Union was a controversial one, as the game's final three seconds were replayed three times by a FIBA (International Basketball Federation) official without the authority to do so, before the Soviet Union won their first gold medal, which would have been won by the United States if the game was not started against the rules. The U.S. filed a formal protest but was rejected by FIBA. As a result, the United States refused to accept the silver medal, and no player has ever claimed his medal. After a protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the United States boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics. The Soviet Union boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics in response. Both boycotts affected basketball at the Olympics, as both had successful basketball teams at the time. Until 1992, the Olympics were restricted to “amateur” players. The advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. In April 1989, through the leadership of Secretary General Borislav Stanković, FIBA approved the rule that allowed NBA players to compete in international tournaments, including the Olympics. In the next Olympics, the 1992 Summer Games, the \"Dream Team\" won the gold medal at the 1992 basketball tournament, with an average winning margin of 44 points per game, and without calling a single time out. By this time, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia no longer existed, but their successor states continued to be among the leading forces. Two newly independent countries of the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, Croatia and Lithuania, won the silver and bronze medals respectively. Americans Sue Bird and Diana Taurasi are the all-time leader for the most Olympic medals in basketball, with five gold, while Teresa Edwards has four gold and one bronze. Seven players have won four medals: American Lisa Leslie, Tamika Catchings, (each with four golds with the women's team) and Carmelo Anthony (three golds and one bronze with the men's team), the Soviet Gennadi Volnov (one gold, two silver, one bronze) and Sergei Belov (one gold, three bronze), and Australians Kristi Harrower and Lauren Jackson (both with three silvers and one bronze). Leslie, Bird, Catchings, and Taurasi are the all-time leaders for the most consecutive gold medal wins in basketball. Six other individuals, all American, have won three golds – Katie Smith, Dawn Staley, Sheryl Swoopes, Seimone Augustus, Sylvia Fowles, Kevin Durant – and 23 other players, not including the previously mentioned, have won three medals. The United States of America is by far the most successful country in Olympic basketball, with United States men's teams having won 16 of 19 tournaments in which they participated, including seven consecutive titles from 1936 through 1968. United States women's teams have won 9 titles out of the 11 tournaments in which they competed, including seven in a row from 1996 to 2020. Besides the United States, Argentina is the only nation still in existence who has won either the men's or women's tournament. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and the Unified Team are the countries no longer in existence who have won the tournament. The United States are the defending champions in both men's and women's tournaments. As of the 2016 Summer Olympics, 90 medals (30 of each color) have been awarded to teams from 20 National Olympic Committees. Two gold medal-winning teams were inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010. The 1960 U.S. Olympic team featured four players who would eventually enter the Hall of Fame, a head coach who would enter the Hall as a contributor, and a team manager who entered the Hall as a coach. The 1992 U.S. Olympic team, better known as the \"Dream Team\", had 11 future Hall of Fame players, along with three coaches who were inducted to the Hall as coaches (one of whom was previously inducted separately for his accomplishments as a player). On June 9, 2017, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee announced that 3x3 basketball would become an official Olympic sport as of the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan, for both men and women.

Top Country Albums is a chart that ranks the top-performing country music albums in the United States, published by Billboard. In 1998, nine different albums topped the chart, based on electronic point of sale data provided by SoundScan Inc. In the issue of Billboard dated January 3, Garth Brooks was at number one with Sevens, the album's fourth week in the top spot. Sevens held the peak position for the first five weeks of the year and returned to number one for five further weeks. Later in the year Brooks achieved two further number ones. In May he topped the chart with The Limited Series, a box set consisting of re-issues of six of his previous albums, five of which had reached number one in their own right. In December he returned to the top spot with the live recording Double Live, which was at number one for the final four weeks of the year. Having been certified more than 20 times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, Double Live is the biggest-selling live album of all time in the United States; it was the singer's ninth chart-topping album of the 1990s, a decade in which he experienced a level of mainstream popularity and success unprecedented for a country artist. Brooks's total of 18 weeks at number one with his three chart-toppers was exceeded by a single week by Canadian singer Shania Twain, who spent 19 non-consecutive weeks atop the chart with her album Come On Over, which had first reached number one late the previous year. The album would eventually spend a total of 50 weeks at number one, making it the longest-running chart-topper in the history of the Top Country Albums listing. In 2000, it was recognized by the Recording Industry Association of America as the highest-selling album of all time by a female artist, as well as the biggest-selling country album. In August, Vince Gill, who had first entered the Top Country Albums chart in 1984, gained his first number one with The Key, which spent a single week in the top spot. He is one of four acts to top the chart in 1998 who are members of the Country Music Hall of Fame, along with Brooks, George Strait and Alan Jackson.

Ten singles from 1973 remained in the top 10 for several weeks at the beginning of the year, while \"My Boy\" by Elvis Presley, \"Streets of London\" by Ralph McTell and \"Wombling Merry Christmas\"/ by The Wombles were all released in 1974 but did not reach their peak until 1975. \"The Show Must Go On\" by Leo Sayer and \"You Won't Find Another Fool Like Me\" by The New Seekers featuring Lyn Paul were the singles from 1973 to reach their peak in 1974. Thirty-one artists scored multiple entries in the top 10 in 1974. ABBA, Barry White, Eric Clapton, Queen and Showaddywaddy were among the many artists who achieved their first UK charting top 10 single in 1974.

Sin Rip (sometimes romanized as Shin Rip or Shin Rib) (Hangul: 신립, Hanja: 申砬; 16 November 1546 – 7 June 1592) was a Korean general and a member of the Pyeongsan Sin clan. He passed the Korean national military examinations at the age of 22. Sin earned prominence by driving out the Nitanggae barbarians from the northern provinces of Joseon dynasty. Sin was a successful general who also gained renown for protecting the borders of Joseon against the Jurchen. When the fortifications at Busan fell to the Japanese at the outset of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598), Sin Rip, the Vice Minister of War, was despatched to Chungju to stop the advancing invaders. He raised a substantial force, 8,000 strong, consisting primarily of cavalry. He was joined at Chungju by Gyeongsang Provincial Governor Kim Su, who had previously collected a large force at Daegu while waiting for a general to be sent from the capital, Hanseong (modern day Seoul). When no general materialized and it was learned that the Japanese were en route, Kim's force largely evaporated. Sin Rip was en route to the Stronghold to block the Choryeong Pass which the Japanese would have to use to move north when he learned that Yi Il's forces had been routed at Sangju by Konishi Yukinaga's First Division and that General Yi had fled, he decided to remain at Chungju and fight the Japanese on level terrain to better employ his cavalry. This, however, left a key choke point undefended and facilitated Konishi's forces' advance northward. Sin selected a large, natural amphitheater at a place called Tangeumdae (탄금대), with mountains at one side and a curving river at the other to make his stand. The only approaches were two narrow passages at either end where the mountains met the river. Apparently Sin chose this site thinking to best employ his cavalry against a Japanese enemy that was predominantly infantry. Modern analysts have also theorized that Sin, in light of reports of Korean forces fleeing in the heat of battle, may have contrived to lock his troops into a life or death situation where they would be forced to fight for their very survival. In the battle, Sin Rip was up against great odds. The Japanese, moreover, were equipped with a type of musket, arquebus, which Sin had not seen in action. The Japanese outnumbered the Korean cavalry by more than 2:1 (18,700 to 8,000) and Sin's cavalry were largely raw recruits plus some scattered remnants of defeated forces from the south. On June 6, 1592, Konishi's troops advanced to crush Sin's forces. The Japanese blocked both the narrow entrances and then sent musketeers and archers to rain down a withering hail of musket balls and arrows on the Korean forces. Suddenly aware of their tactical disadvantage, many of the Korean forces broke ranks and frantically tried to escape through one or the other of the passages, but were either cut down by the Japanese or drowned in the river. A few broke through the Japanese lines and fled. Sin and his officers escaped but committed suicide rather than being taken prisoner by the Japanese.

The Tackitt home was located on the old Fort Belknap and Austin Road, about nine miles south of the post, near Fish Creek: so named for the Tackitts broke the ice and caught fish during the severe winter weather.....in the evening of February 13, 1860, one of Mr. Tackitt's milk cows came home through the sleet and snow with an arrow sticking in her side......[Tackitt] back-tracked the cows about three-fourths of a mile, to where they found moccasin racks and saw blankets hanging on the east end of Tackitt Mountain. Tackitt thought it unwise to make an open attack, but decided to advance upon the Indian's from the north......Almost instantly several Indians charged like wild demons. These Indians were under the leadership of , who only a few months before lived on the Comanche Reservation, near old Camp Cooper. Tackitt and his sons knew him well, and no doubt, Piny Chummy recognized the Tackitts......Old Piny Chummy charged Parson Tackitt himself, and the old chief received a mortal wound from the discharge of the parson's gun......A white flag was found flying from the top of a tree on Tackitt Mountain; and under it were found four bridles, four ropes, four bows, and four quivers of arrows, as well as blankets and other implements. A few days later, soaring vultures disclosed the graves of four warriors killed in this fight. '\"

It is the location in Idaho where the Lewis and Clark Expedition emerged from crossing the Bitterroot Mountains on the Lolo Trail and first met the Nez Perce tribe of Native Americans. The field is now part of Nez Perce National Historical Park. On September 20, 1805 the first members of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery, including Clark himself, emerged starving and weak onto the Weippe Prairie. There they encountered the Nez Perce, who were attracted to the area by the abundant hunting, as well as the fields of camas flowers, whose roots were a staple of their diet. The Nez Perce \"had never before seen white men\", and \"proved to be the most helpful of the tribes which the explorers encountered in their travels\". By September 22, 1805, the entire expedition made it to Weippe Prairie. Lewis and Clark met many of the Nez Perce chiefs. One of them, Red Bear, gave them dressed buckskins. Lewis and Clark reciprocated with presents of \"beads and a few other articles\". The Nez Perce \"later found the white man's gifts to be cheap.\" The Nez Perce purportedly were predisposed to be friendly to the white explorers due to the positive stories told by a young woman of their tribe who had been stolen and sold into slavery, eventually sold to and lived with white people, and then returned to the Nez Perce. This woman, named Watkuweis (meaning \"returned from a faraway country\"), when hearing of the arrival of Lewis and Clark, pleaded that they not be harmed. Her tales of the kindness she had experienced with the white people reportedly convinced the Nez Perce to offer friendship to the explorers. The Nez Perce provided camas root cakes and other food, helped them build canoes for their continued westward journey and mapped out the water route the expedition would follow. The expedition cached some materials there, and found the caches untouched when they returned in spring 1806. They also left the expedition's horses. The Nez Perce were divided about returning the horses, but the Corps eventually regained most of them. Upon their return in 1806, they spent an extended time from May to late June with the Nez Perce, due to the late spring in the Bitterroot Mountains. The part of Weippe Prairie most associated with the Lewis and Clark expedition, covered with camas and close to the town of Weippe, Idaho, was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966. It is one of 38 scattered sites covered by the Nez Perce National Historical Park which interprets the site. The name Weippe, pronounced WEE-ipe, is derived from a Nez-Perce name whose meaning has been variously defined as a \"very old place\" or as referring to a spring of water or the camas grounds. A literal translation has not been found. \"This national historic landmark is also associated with the 1877 Nez Perce War; the nontreaty bands held a council on this prairie following the Clearwater Battle.\"

William M. Runyan (1870–1957) was a Christian composer from the United States who wrote the music to the well-known hymn Great Is Thy Faithfulness. In 1870, William Marion Runyan was born in Marion, New York to a Methodist minister Rev. William White Runyan (born 1828) and his wife Hannah (Orcutt) Runyan (born 1839). At age fourteen, Runyan and his family moved to Marion, Kansas. As a youth, Runyan served as a church organist and graduated from Marion High School in Kansas. Runyan was ordained as a Methodist minister at age twenty-one and then pastored various congregations in Kansas. Runyan attended Northwestern University for three years from 1895 to 1898. Starting in 1915 Runyan began writing gospel songs with the encouragement of D.B. Towner of the Moody Bible Institute. In 1923 Runyan moved from Wichita to Chicago. From 1924 to 1926 Runyan was affiliated with John Brown University in Siloam Springs, Arkansas pastoring the Federated Church, and editing the Christian Workers' Magazine. Runyan then moved back to Chicago where he worked with the Moody Bible Institute, and he worked as editor for Hope Publishing Company, co-editing \"The Service Hymnal\" with Gordon Shorney. In 1923 Runyan composed the music to the song \"Great is Thy Faithfulness,\" originally a poem by Thomas O. Chisholm, a friend and fellow Methodist minister. Runyan retired from Hope in 1948 and received the honorary Doctor of Letters from Wheaton College. Runyan lived for a period of his retirement in Galveston, Texas and died on July 29, 1957 in Pittsburg, Kansas. He is buried in Baldwin City, Kansas. Runyan was a professor and preacher at Baker University in Baldwin City for a period and his children attended the University. Runyan's survivors endowed \"The Rev. William M. Runyan Endowed Memorial Scholarship\" at Baker University with the royalties from his song \"Great is Thy Faithfulness.\"

Wool House is a grade II listed Victorian wool warehouse at 74 Backchurch Lane, in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. It was originally five storeys tall, and spanned a total of 137,455 square feet (12,770.0 m2). An additional floor was constructed on the roof in the early 2000s, creating an additional 12,000 square feet (1,100 m2) of floorspace. The warehouse is one of two that were constructed on Backchurch lane in the late 1880s for Browne & Eagle, a wool storage firm. Wool House underwent a series of redevelopments in the early 21st century. The first of these took place between 1998 and 2003, when the building was refurbished and converted into office space. An extra floor constructed from lightweight materials was also added. In 2005 the offices closed down and the building was redesigned for residential usage. The residential conversion was completed in October 2006. The Wool House is now owned by Octagon Investments which is part of the Yianis Group owned by property magnate John Christodoulou who according to the Times Rich List 2007 is the 82nd wealthiest person in Britain with an estimated personal fortune of £835m. The warehouse was the setting for the second series of the BBC television series Dragons Den.
