**Examples_pyclausie_vs_spacy-clausie.md** shows the performance of pyclausie vs the implementation of clausie in spacy.

**processed_sentences_cw5.txt** are the simplified sentences generated during coding week 5. More info in the [coding week 5 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week5)

**stats** is a file containing several json files with the most common verbs, prepositions and verbs+prepositions in a sample of 10000 DBpedia abstracts (of simple and complex sentences). More info in the [coding week 7 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week7)

**cumsum_prepositions.png** and **cumsum_verbs.png** is a plot representing the cumulative sum of verbs and prepositions. More info in the [coding week 7 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week7)

**generated_rdf_triples_cw8.txt** RDF triples generated for a test set of DBpedia abstracts. More info in the [coding week 8 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week8)

**errors_object_tobe.txt** RDF triples with the verb to be as predicate and literals as objects. The main purpose was to extract from the file new lexicalizations of DBpedia classes. More info in the [coding week 9 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week9)

**cumsum_verbs_top10.png** similar to the previous cumsum plots. Plot of the top 10 most common verbs in simple sentences with the cumulative sum. More info in the [coding week 9 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week9) and [coding week 7 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week7)

**num_sentences.png** Plot with the number of sentences extracted from 10000 abstracts. More info in the [coding week 9 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week9)

**num_triples.png** Plot with the number of triples extracted from 10000 abstracts. More info in the [coding week 9 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week9)

**num_predicate_errors.png** Plot with the number of predicate errors in the triples extracted from 10000 abstracts. More info in the [coding week 9 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week9)

**total_num_errors.png** Plot with the number of errors (any literal in the triple) in the triples extracted from 10000 abstracts. More info in the [coding week 9 blog post](https://fcabla.github.io/DBpedia-abstracts-to-RDF/coding-week9)
